By connecting different systems that make up your enterprise, you can build an organization that acts as one seamless digital system. WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) is an open source product that enables comprehensive integration for cloud native and container-native projects. WSO2 EI enables you to do the following: Optimize systems and resources Leverage the cloud Reuse legacy systems Create a connected ecosystem for both your customers and partners. Connect enterprise systems to one another Make data accessible accross the enterprise Provide intuitive and visual development tools for continous integration and continous development Help integration developers to create new services and assets WSO2 EI comprises of profiles that offer different integration capabilities. The ESB profile in WSO2 EI provides its fundamental services through an event-driven and standards-based messaging engine (the bus), which allows integration architects to exploit the value of messaging without writing code. This ESB profile is a step ahead of the previous releases of WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus, as it provides data integration capabilities within the same runtime. This eliminates the need to use a separate data services server for your integration processes. The following diagram illustrates the message-flow architecture in the ESB profile of WSO2 EI, which is used for implementing integration flows. This shows how a request propagates to its actual endpoint through the ESB profile. Response handling is the reverse of this operation. Note that the components of the pipes are not in a specific order. An application (client) sends a message to the ESB profile of WSO2 EI. The message is picked up by a transport. The transport sends the message through a message pipe, which handles quality of service aspects such as security. Internally, this pipe is the in-flow and out-flow of the Axis2 engine. The ESB profile can operate in two modes: Mediating Messages - A single pipe is used. Proxy Services - Separate pipes connecting the transport to different proxy services are used. Both message transformation and routing can be considered as a single unit. As the diagram specifies, there is no clear separation between message transformation components and routing components. In the ESB profile of WSO2 EI, this is known as the mediation framework. Some transformations take place before the routing decision has been made while others take place after the routing decision. This is part of the Synapse implementation. The message is injected to the separate pipes depending on the destinations. Here again, quality of service aspects of the messages are determined. The transport layer takes care of the transport protocol transformations that are required before sending the message to the receiver application. The message is sent to the receiver application.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/introduction/#introduction","text":"Integration is at the heart of any digital transformation.

Syntax: base64Encode(string value) base64Encode(string value, string charset) base64Decode() function \u00b6 The base64Decode function returns the original value of the specified base64-encoded value. Syntax: base64Decode(string encodedValue) base64Decode(string encodedValue , string charset) get-property() function \u00b6 The get-property() function allows any XPath expression used in a configuration to look up information from the current message context. Using the Property mediator , you can retrieve properties from the message context and header. The syntax of the function takes the following format. get-property(String propertyName) get-property(String scope, String propertyName) The function accepts scope as an optional parameter. It retrieves a message property at the given scope, which can be one of the following. Synapse scope axis2 scope axis2-client transport scope registry scope system scope operation scope If you provide only the property name without the scope, the default s ynapse scope will be used. Info When the result of an XPath evaluation results in a single XML node, the evaluator will return the text content of this node by default (equivalent of doing /root/body/node/text()). If you want to retrieve the node itself, you can configure the Enrich mediator as shown in the following example. <inSequence> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"WHERE\" value=\"before doing stuff\"/> </log> <enrich> <source type=\"body\" clone=\"true\"/> <target type=\"property\" property=\"ENRICH_PROPERTY\"/> </enrich> <property name=\"PROPERTY_PROPERTY\" expression=\"$body/child::node()\" scope=\"default\"/> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"WHERE\" value=\"before doing stuff\"/> <property name=\"ENRICH_PROPERTY\" expression=\"get-property('ENRICH_PROPERTY')\"/> <property name=\"PROPERTY_PROPERTY\" expression=\"get-property('PROPERTY_PROPERTY')\"/> </log> <enrich> <source type=\"property\" clone=\"true\" property=\"ENRICH_PROPERTY\"/> <target type=\"body\" action=\"sibling\"/> </enrich> <log level=\"full\"/> </inSequence> Synapse scope \u00b6 When the scope of a property mediator is synapse , its value is available throughout both the in sequence and the out sequence. In addition to the user-defined properties, you can retrieve the following special properties from the synapse scope. Name Return Value To Incoming URL as a String, or empty string (\u00ab\u00bb) if a To address is not defined. From From address as a String, or empty string (\u00ab\u00bb) if a From address is not defined. Action SOAP Addressing Action header value as a String, or empty string (\u00ab\u00bb) if an Action is not defined. FaultTo SOAP FaultTo header value as a String, or empty string (\u00ab\u00bb) if a FaultTo address is not defined. ReplyTo ReplyTo header value as a String, or empty string (\u00ab\u00bb) if a ReplyTo address is not defined. MessageID A unique identifier (UUID) for the message as a String, or empty string (\u00ab\u00bb) if a MessageID is not defined. This ID is guaranteed to be unique. FAULT TRUE if the message has a fault, or empty string if the message does not have a fault. MESSAGE_FORMAT Returns pox, get, soap11, or soap12 depending on the message. If a message type is unknown this returns soap12 OperationName Operation name corresponding to the message. A proxy service with a WSDL can have different operations. If the WSDL is not defined, ESB defines fixed operations. To access a property with the synapses cope inside the mediate() method of a mediator, you can include the following configuration in a custom mediator created using the Class mediator : public boolean mediate(org.apache.synapse.MessageContext mc) { // Available in both in-sequence and out-sequenc String propValue = (String) mc.getProperty(\"PropName\"); System.out.println(\"SCOPE_SYNAPSE : \" + propValue); return true; } axis2 scope \u00b6 When the scope of a property mediator is axis2 , its value is available only throughout the sequence for which the property is defined (e.g., if you add the property to an in sequence, its value will be available only throughout the in sequence). You can retrieve message context properties within the axis2 scope using the following syntax. Syntax: get-property('axis2', String propertyName) To access a property with the axis2 scope inside the mediate() method of a mediator, you can include the following configuration in a custom mediator created using the Class mediator : public boolean mediate(org.apache.synapse.MessageContext mc) { org.apache.axis2.context.MessageContext axis2MsgContext; axis2MsgContext = ((Axis2MessageContext) mc).getAxis2MessageContext(); // Available only in the sequence the property is defined. String propValue = (String) axis2MsgContext.getProperty(\"PropName\"); System.out.println(\"SCOPE_AXIS2 : \" + propValue); return true; } axis2-client \u00b6 This is similar to the synapse scope. The difference is that it can be accessed inside the mediate() method of a mediator by including one of the following configurations in a custom mediator, created using the Class mediator : public boolean mediate(org.apache.synapse.MessageContext mc) { org.apache.axis2.context.MessageContext axis2MsgContext; axis2MsgContext = ((Axis2MessageContext) mc).getAxis2MessageContext(); String propValue = (String) axis2MsgContext.getProperty(\"PropName\"); System.out.println(\"SCOPE_AXIS2_CLIENT - 1 : \" + propValue); or propValue = (String) axis2MsgContext.getOptions().getProperty(\"PropName\"); System.out.println(\"SCOPE_AXIS2_CLIENT - 2: \" + propValue); return true; } transport scope \u00b6 When the scope of a property mediator is transport , it will be added to the transport header of the outgoing message from the ESB profile. You can retrieve message context properties within the transport scope using the following syntax. Syntax: get-property('transport', String propertyName) registry scope \u00b6 You can retrieve properties within the registry using the following syntax. Syntax: get-property('registry', String registryPath@propertyName) get-property('registry', String registryPath) system scope \u00b6 You can retrieve Java System properties using the following syntax . Syntax: get-property('system', String propertyName) operation scope \u00b6 You can retrieve a property in the operation context level from the operation scope. The properties within iterated/cloned message with the operation scope are preserved in the in sequence even if you have configured your API resources to be sent through the fault sequence when faults exist. A given property with the operation scope only exists in a single request and can be accessed by a single resource. The properties in this scope are passed to the error handler when the FORCE_ERROR_ON_SOAP_FAULT property is set to true . See FORCE_ERROR_ON_SOAP_FAULT section in Generic Properties for more information. Syntax: get-property('operation', String propertyName) url-encode() function \u00b6 The url-encode function returns the URL-encoded value of the specified string. Syntax: url-encode(string value) url-encode(string value, string charset) Synapse XPath Variables \u00b6 There is a set of predefined XPath variables that you can directly use to write XPaths in the Synapse configuration, instead of using the synapse:get-property() function . These XPath variables get properties of various scopes as follows: XPath Extension Functions Synapse XPath Variables $body \u00b6 The SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 body element. For example, the expression $body//getQuote refers to the first getQuote element in a SOAP body, regardless of whether the message is SOAP-11 or SOAP-12. We have discussed an example below. Example of $body usage : Deploy the following proxy service using instructions in Creating a Proxy Service . Note the property, <property xmlns:m0=\" http://services.samples \" name=\"stockprop\" expression=\"$body//m0:getQuote\"/> in the configuration.

You can invoke services either in blocking or non-blocking manner. When you invoke a service in non-blocking mode, the underlying worker thread returns without waiting for the response. In blocking mode, the underlying worker thread gets blocked and waits for the response after sending the request to the endpoint. Call mediator in blocking mode is very much similar to the Callout mediator . In both blocking and non-blocking modes, Call mediator behaves in a synchronous manner. Hence, mediation pauses after the service invocation, and resumes from the next mediator in the sequence when the response is received. Call mediator allows you to create your configuration independent from the underlying architecture. Non-blocking mode of the Call mediator leverages the non-blocking transports for better performance. Therefore, it is recommended to use it in non-blocking mode as much as possible. However, there are scenarios where you need to use the blocking mode. For example, when you implement a scenario related to JMS transactions, it is vital to use the underlying threads in blocking mode. In blocking mode, Call mediator uses the <EI_HOME>/conf/axis2/axis2_blocking_client.xml file as the Axis2 configuration. You can obtain the service endpoint for the Call mediator as follows: Pick from message-level information Pick from a pre-defined endpoint If you do not specify an endpoint, the Call mediator tries to send the message using the WSA:TO address of the message. If you specify an endpoint, the Call mediator sends the message based on the specified endpoint. The endpoint type can be Leaf Endpoint (i.e. Address/WSDL/Default/HTTP) or Group Endpoint (i.e. Failover/Load balance/Recipient list). Group Endpoint is only supported in non-blocking mode. Info The Call mediator is a content-unaware mediator. Set up | Syntax | Configuration | Example Set up \u00b6 Enabling mutual SSL in the blocking mode \u00b6 When using the Call mediator in the blocking mode (blocking=true), enable the mediator to handle mutual SSL by adding the following JVM settings to the <EI_HOME>/bin/integrator.sh file: -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=\"$CARBON_HOME/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks\" \\ -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=\"wso2carbon\" \\ -Djavax.net.ssl.keyPassword=\"wso2carbon\" \\ -Drampart.axiom.parser.pool=false \\ S yntax \u00b6 <call [blocking=\"true\"] /> If the message is to be sent to one or more endpoints, use the following syntax: <call [blocking=\"true\"]> (endpointref | endpoint)+ </call> The endpointref token refers to the following: <endpoint key=\"name\"/> The endpoint token refers to an anonymous endpoint definition. Configuration \u00b6 Select one of the following options to define the endpoint to which, the message should be delivered. Parameter Name Description None Select this option if you do not want to provide an endpoint. The Call mediator will send the message using its wsa:to address. Define Inline If this is selected, the endpoint to which the message should be sent can be included within the Call mediator configuration. Click Add to add the required endpoint. For more information on Adding an endpoint, see Adding an Endpoint . Pick From Registry If this is selected, the message can be sent to a pre-defined endpoint which is currently saved as a resource in the registry. Click either Configuration Registry or Governance Registry as relevant to select the required endpoint from the resource tree. XPath If this is selected, the endpoint to which the message should be sent will be derived via an XPath expression. You are required to enter the relevant XPath expression in the text field that appears when this option is selected. !!! tip You can click NameSpaces to add namespaces if you are providing an expression.

Blocking If set to true , you can use the call mediator in blocking mode. Example \u00b6 Example 1 - Service orchestration \u00b6 In this example, t he Call mediator invokes a backend service. An Enrich mediator stores the response received for that service invocation. The Filter Mediator added after the Call mediator carries out a filter to determine whether the first call has been successful. If it is successful, second backend service is invoked. The payload of the request to the second backend is the response of the first service invocation . After a successful second backend service invocation, response of the first service is retrieved by the Enrich mediator from the property where it was formerly stored. This response is sent to the client by the Respond mediator . If it is not successful, a custom JSON error message is sent with HTTP 500. If the first call itself is not successful, the output is just sent back with the relevant error code. <target> <inSequence> <log/> <call> <endpoint> <http method=\"get\" uri-template=\"http://192.168.1.10:8088/mockaxis2service\"/> </endpoint> </call> <enrich> <source type=\"body\" clone=\"true\"/> <target type=\"property\" action=\"child\" property=\"body_of_first_call\"/> </enrich> <filter source=\"get-property('axis2', 'HTTP_SC')\" regex=\"200\"> <then> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"switchlog\" value=\"Case: first call successful\"/> </log> <call> <endpoint> <http method=\"get\" uri-template=\"http://localhost:8080/MockService1\"/> </endpoint> </call> <filter source=\"get-property('axis2', 'HTTP_SC')\" regex=\"200\"> <then> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"switchlog\" value=\"Case: second call successful\"/> </log> <enrich> <source type=\"property\" clone=\"true\" property=\"body_of_first_call\"/> <target type=\"body\"/> </enrich> <respond/> </then> <else> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"switchlog\" value=\"Case: second call unsuccessful\"/> </log> <property name=\"HTTP_SC\" value=\"500\" scope=\"axis2\"/> <payloadFactory media-type=\"json\"> <format>{ \"status\": \"ERROR!\"}</format> <args/> </payloadFactory> <respond/> </else> </filter> </then> <else> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"switchlog\" value=\"Case: first call unsuccessful\"/> </log> <respond/> </else> </filter> </inSequence> </target> Example 2 - Continuing mediation without waiting for responses \u00b6 In this example, the message will be cloned by the Clone Mediator and sent via the Call mediator. The Drop mediator drops the response so that no further mediation is carried out for the cloned message. However, since the continueParent attribute of the Clone mediator is set to true , the original message is mediated in parallel. Therefore, the Log Mediator at the end of the configuration will log the After call mediator log message without waiting for the Call mediator response. ... <log level=\"full\"/> <clone continueParent=\"true\"> <target> <sequence> <call> <endpoint> <address uri=\"http://localhost:8080/echoString\"/> </endpoint> </call> <drop/> </sequence> </target> </clone> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"MESSAGE\" value=\"After call mediator\"/> </log> ... Example 3 - Call mediator in blocking mode \u00b6 In the following sample configuration, the Header Mediator is used to add the action, the PayloadFactory Mediator is used to store the the request message and the Call mediator is used to invoke a backend service.

Setup | Syntax | Configuration | Samples Setup \u00b6 Enabling mutual SSL \u00b6 Since the Callout mediator is run based on the configuration of the axis2_blocking_client.xml file, its default https transport sender is org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender . Therefore, the Callout mediator does not have access to the required key store to handle mutual SSL. To enable the Callout mediator to handle mutual SSL, the following JVM settings should be added to the <EI_HOME>/bin/integrator.sh file. -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=\"$CARBON_HOME/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks\" \\ -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=\"wso2carbon\" \\ -Djavax.net.ssl.keyPassword=\"wso2carbon\" \\ Disabling chunking \u00b6 The Callout mediator is not affected by the DISABLE_CHUNKING property . Instead, you can disable chunking for the Callout mediator by setting the Transfer-Encoding parameter to none in CommonsHTTPTransportSender of axis2_blocking_client.xml as follows: <parameter name=\"Transfer-Encoding\">none</parameter> For example: <transportSender name=\"http\" class=\"org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender\"> <parameter name=\"PROTOCOL\">HTTP/1.1</parameter> <parameter name=\"Transfer-Encoding\">none</parameter> <parameter name=\"cacheHttpClient\">true</parameter> <parameter name=\"defaultMaxConnectionsPerHost\">200</parameter> </transportSender> This will disable chunking for all Callout mediators present in the EI server. If you want to disable chunking for only a single Callout mediator instance, create a new axis2.xml file by copying the axis2_blocking_client.xml file, set the Transfer-Encoding parameter as shown, and then configure that Callout mediator to use this new axis2.xml file as described below. Syntax \u00b6 <callout [serviceURL=\"string\"] [action=\"string\"] [initAxis2ClientOptions=\"true|false\"] [endpointKey=\"string\"]> <configuration [axis2xml=\"string\"] [repository=\"string\"]/>? <source xpath=\"expression\" | key=\"string\" | type=\"envelope\"/> <target xpath=\"expression\" | key=\"string\"/> <enableSec policy=\"string\" | outboundPolicy=\"String\" | inboundPolicy=\"String\" />? </callout> Configuration \u00b6 There will be a slight difference in the UI depending on the option you select for the Specify as parameter. Click on the relevant tab to view the required UI. The parameters available for configuring the Callout mediator are as follows. Parameter Name Description Specify As This parameter determines whether the target external service should be configured by using either a serviceURL attribute or an endpointKey attribute. !!! note Callout mediator does not support endpoint configurations such as timeout , suspendOnFailure and markForSuspension when the endpointKey attribute is used to specify an existing endpoint. URL : Select URL if you want to call the external service by specifying its URL in the Call mediator configuration. Address Endpoint : Selected Address Endpoint if you want to call the external service via an Endpoint which is already saved in the Registry . This option should be selected if you want to make use of the WSO2 functionality related to endpoints such as format conversions, security etc. Note that only Leaf endpoint types (i.e. Address , WSDL , Default and Http ) are supported for the Callout mediator. If neither a URL or an address endpoint is specified, the To header on the request is used as the target endpoint. URL If you selected URL for the Specify As parameter, use this parameter to enter the URL of the external service that you want to call. This URL will be used as the End Point Reference (EPR) of the external service. Address Endpoint If you selected Address Endpoint for the Specify As parameter, use this parameter to enter key to access the endpoint that should be used to call the external service. Click Configuration Registry or Governance Registry as relevant to select the required endpoint from the resource tree. Action The SOAP action which should be appended to the service call. Axis2 Repository The path to Axis2 client repository where the services and modules are located. The purpose of this parameter is to make the Callout mediator initialize with the required client repository. Axis2 XML The path to the location of the Axis2.xml configuration file. The purpose of this parameter is to make the Callout mediator initialize with the relevant Axis2 configurations. initAxis2ClientOptions If this parameter is set to false , the existing Axis2 client options available in the Synapse message context will be reused when the Callout mediator is invoked. This is useful when you want to use NLTM authentication. The default value for this parameter is true . Source This parameter defines the payload for the request. It can be defined using one of the following options. XPath - This option allows you to specify an expression that defines the location in the message. !!! info Tip You can click NameSpaces to add namespaces if you are providing an expression. Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Property - This option allows you to specify the payload for a request via a property included in the mediation flow. Envelope - This option allows you to select the entire envelope which is available in the message flow as the source. Target The node or the property of the request message to which the payload (resulting from the value specified for the Source parameter) would be attached. The target can be specified using one of the following options. XPath - This option allows you to specify an expression that defines the location in the message. !!! info Tip You can click NameSpaces to add namespaces if you are providing an expression. Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Property - This option allows you to specify a property included in the mediation flow. WS-Security If you select the check box, WS-Security is enabled for the Callout mediator. This section would expand as shown below when you select this check box. Specify as Inbound and Outbound Policies If this check box is selected, you can define separate security policies for the inbound and outbound messages (flows). This is done by entering the required policy keys in the Outbound Policy Key and Inbound Policy Key parameters which are displayed as follows when this check box is selected. You can click Configuration Registry or Governance Registry to select a security policy saved in the Registry from the resource tree. Policy Key If the Specify as Inbound and Outbound Policies check box is not selected, this parameter is used to enter a key to access a security policy which will be applied to both inbound and outbound messages. You can click Configuration Registry or Governance Registry to select a security policy saved in the Registry from the resource tree. Examples Following examples demonstrate the usage of the Callout mediator. Example 1 - Performing a direct service invocation \u00b6 In this example, the Callout Mediator does the direct service invocation to the StockQuoteService using the client request, gets the response, and sets the response as the first child of the SOAP message body. You can then use the Send Mediator to send the message back to the client. <callout serviceURL=\"http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService\" action=\"urn:getQuote\"> <source xmlns:s11=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:s12=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\" xpath=\"s11:Body/child::*[fn:position()=1] | s12:Body/child::*[fn:position()=1]\"/> <target xmlns:s11=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:s12=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\" xpath=\"s11:Body/child::*[fn:position()=1] | s12:Body/child::*[fn:position()=1]\"/> </callout> Example 2 - Setting an HTTP method when invoking a REST service \u00b6 The below example uses a C allout mediator to set a HTTP method when invoking a REST service. Info For this, you need to define the following property: <property name=\"HTTP_METHOD\" expression=\"$axis2:HTTP_METHOD\" scope=\"axis2-client\"/> <proxy xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\" name=\"CalloutProxy\" startOnLoad=\"true\" statistics=\"disable\" trace=\"disable\" transports=\"http,https\"> <target> <inSequence> <property name=\"enableREST\" scope=\"axis2-client\" type=\"BOOLEAN\" value=\"true\"/> <property expression=\"$axis2:HTTP_METHOD\" name=\"HTTP_METHOD\" scope=\"axis2-client\"/> <callout initAxis2ClientOptions=\"false\" serviceURL=\"http://localhost:8280/callout/CalloutRESTApi\"> <source type=\"envelope\"/> <target key=\"response\"/> </callout> <log level=\"custom\"> <property expression=\"$ctx:response\" name=\"MESSAGE###########################3\"/> </log> <property expression=\"$ctx:response\" name=\"res\" type=\"OM\"/> <property action=\"remove\" name=\"NO_ENTITY_BODY\" scope=\"axis2\"/> <property name=\"RESPONSE\" value=\"true\"/> <property name=\"messageType\" scope=\"axis2\" value=\"application/xml\"/> <header action=\"remove\" name=\"To\"/> <payloadFactory media-type=\"xml\"> <format> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"> <soapenv:Header/> <soapenv:Body>$1 </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> </format> <args> <arg evaluator=\"xml\" expression=\"$ctx:res\"/> </args> </payloadFactory> <send/> </inSequence> </target> <description/> </proxy> Samples \u00b6 Sample 430: Callout Mediator for Synchronous Service Invocation .","title":"Callout Mediator"},{"location":"references/callout-Mediator/#callout-mediator","text":"The Callout mediator performs a blocking external service invocation during mediation.

Mediators provide an easy way of extending the ESB. When you have a scenario that requires functionality not provided by the existing mediators, you can write your own custom mediators to implement your specific business requirements. Your custom mediators then must be plugged into the ESB profile. After adding them to the ESB profile, they function together with core mediators that come with the product. The custom mediators can be distributed in a packaged form that can be installed in another ESB profile instance. Writing an ESB Mediator Building the mediator Deploying the custom mediator Writing an ESB Mediator \u00b6 There are two ways of writing an ESB mediator: Using the Class Mediator - This does not allow mediator specific XML configurations. See Writing Custom Mediator Implementations for more information. Writing the mediator with factory and serialize methods - This allows mediator to have its own XML configuration. See Writing Custom Configuration Implementations for Mediators for more information. The easiest way to write a mediator is to extend your mediator class from the org.apache.synapse.mediators.AbstractMediator class. For example, you can see the following articles in the WSO2 library: Writing a Mediator in WSO2 EI - Part 1 Writing a Mediator in WSO2 EI - Part 2 Tip You can use the Class mediator and custom mediators for user-specific custom developments when there is no built-in mediator that already provides the required functionality. However, class and custom mediators incur a high maintenance overhead. Custom mediators in particular might introduce version migration complications when upgrading WSO2 EI. Therefore, avoid using them unless the scenario is frequently re-used and heavily user-specific. For best results, use WSO2 EI Tooling to debug Class and custom mediators. Building the mediator \u00b6 After you write the mediator, you must build it and make it an OSGI bundle so that it will work with the ESB. Basic approach \u00b6 Create a regular JAR that links to the Synpase core JAR and place it in the <EI_HOME>/ lib directory. The platform will automatically make it an OSGI bundle and deploy it to the server. Advanced approach \u00b6 If you want to control the way your mediator is created as an OSGI bundle, you must write the POM files so that you can export and import the packages you need, as shown in the examples below. Following is a POM file that creates the mediator using Class Mediator . <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd\"> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <groupId>org.test</groupId> <artifactId>org.test</artifactId> <version>1.0.0</version> <packaging>bundle</packaging> <name>My Samples - Test mediator</name> <url>http://www.test.com</url> <repositories> <repository> <id>wso2-maven2-repository</id> <url>http://dist.wso2.org/maven2</url> </repository> <repository> <id>apache-Incubating-repo</id> <name>Maven Incubating Repository</name> <url>http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-incubating-repository</url> </repository> <repository> <id>apache-maven2-repo</id> <name>Apache Maven2 Repository</name> <url>http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</url> </repository> </repositories> <build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> <configuration> <source>1.5</source> <target>1.5</target> </configuration> </plugin> <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId> <artifactId>maven-bundle-plugin</artifactId> <version>1.4.0</version> <extensions>true</extensions> <configuration> <instructions> <Bundle-SymbolicName>org.test</Bundle-SymbolicName> <Bundle-Name>org.test</Bundle-Name> <Export-Package> org.test.mediator.*, </Export-Package> <Import-Package> *; resolution:=optional </Import-Package> </instructions> </configuration> </plugin> </plugins> </build> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.synapse</groupId> <artifactId>synapse-core</artifactId> <version>2.1.1-wso2v5</version> </dependency> </dependencies> </project> Info The Maven bundle plug-in was used for creating the OSGI bundle here.

However, there are three places inside the WSO2 EI distribution for placing the JAR file of a customer mediator. They are: <EI_HOME>\\extensions <EI_HOME>\\dropins <EI_HOME>\\lib Tip The recommended way is to copy the JAR files into the extensions directory. If you deploy a mediator through a Carbon Application (CAR file), it can only be accessed from the Sequences and Proxy Services within the same CAR file. You need to restart the server after copying the JAR file of the custom mediator into any of these directories. Extensions directory \u00b6 If you created a regular non-OSGI mediator, build it and copy the JAR file into this directory. The system will convert the JAR file of the mediator into an OSGI-JAR and deploy it into the server. This way is easy and simple. However, in this method, you cannot use any OSGI features within the mediator implementation. For example, you cannot make certain packages private or import specific versions of packages. Also, in this method, other than Class mediators, you can use a mediator, which has its own XML configuration. Dropins directory \u00b6 If your custom mediator is a Class mediator, it would be a normal bundle. Instead, if it is a mediator with an XML configuration, then it should be a fragment of the Synapse core, and thereby, you need to create an OSGI bundle for that. This requires basic knowledge about OSGI and the Maven bundle plug-in. If you created your custom mediator as an OSGI bundle, you can place its JAR file in the dropins directory.

It converts and transforms one data format to another, or changes the structure of the data in a message. It provides WSO2 Integration Studio to create a graphical mapping configuration and generates the files required to execute this graphical mapping configuration by the WSO2 Data Mapper engine. WSO2 Data Mapper is an independent component that does not depend on any other WSO2 product. However, other products can use the Data Mapper to achieve/offer data mapping capabilities. Data Mapper Mediator is the intermediate component you need for that, which gives the data mapping capability into the ESB profile of WSO2 EI. Data Mapper mediator finds the configuration files from the Registry and configures the Data Mapper Engine with the input message type (XML/JSON/CSV) and output message type (XML/JSON/CSV). Then it takes the request message from the ESB profile message flow and uses the configured Data Mapper Engine to execute the transformation and adds the output message to the ESB profile message flow. Info The Data Mapper mediator is a content-aware mediator. Prerequisites Syntax Configuration Components of Data Mapper Data Mapper element and attribute types Data Mapper operations Examples Prerequisites \u00b6 You need to install the WSO2 Integration Studio to use the Data Mapper mediator. For instructions on installing this Plugin, see Installing WSO2 Integration Studio .

Parameter name Description Mapping Configuration The file, which contains the script file that is used to execute the mapping. You need to create a mapping configuration file using the WSO2 Integration Studio plugin, and store it either in the Configuration Registry or Governance Registry, to select and upload it from here. Input Schema JSON schema, which represents the input message format. You need to create an input schema file using the WSO2 Integration Studio plugin, and store it either in the Configuration Registry or Governance Registry to select and upload it from here. Output Schema JSON schema, which represents the output message format.

Input Type Expected input message type (XML/JSON/CSV) Output Type Target output message type (XML/JSON/CSV) Components of Data Mapper \u00b6 WSO2 Data Mapper consists of two components. They are Data Mapper Tooling and Data Mapper Engine. Data Mapper Tooling \u00b6 Data Mapper Tooling component is the interface used to create configuration files that are required by the Data Mapper Engine to execute the mapping. Following three configuration files are needed by the Data Mapper engine. Input schema file Output schema file Mapping configuration file These three files are generated by the Data Mapper Tool and saved in a Registry Resource project, which you deploy in a WSO2 server as shown in the example below. {width=\"542\" height=\"229\"} Info The .datamapper and .datamapper_diagram files as shown in the example above contain meta data related to the Data Mapper diagram. They are ignored when you deploy the project to a server to be used by the Data Mapper Engine. Only the two schema files and the .dmc (Data Mapper Configuration) get deployed. Input and output schema files \u00b6 Input and output schema files are custom-defined JSON schemas that define the input/output format of input/output messages. T he Data Mapper tool generates them when loading the input and output files as shown below. Info You can also create the input and output JSON Schemas manually using the Data Mapper Diagram Editor. For instructions, see Creating a JSON Schema Manually . {width=\"900\" height=\"192\"} {width=\"567\" height=\"250\"} You can load the following input/output message formats: Info When loading a sample input XML file, you cannot have the default namespace (i.e. without a prefix in the namespace element). Also, you need to use the same prefix in all occurrences that refer to the same namespace within one XML file. For example, see the use of the prefix axis2ns11 in the example below. {.expand-control-image} Sample input XML file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"> <soapenv:Header> <axis2ns11:LimitInfoHeader xmlns:axis2ns11=\"urn:partner.soap.sforce.com\"> <axis2ns11:limitInfo> <axis2ns11:current>42336</axis2ns11:current> <axis2ns11:limit>83000</axis2ns11:limit> <axis2ns11:type>API REQUESTS</axis2ns11:type> </axis2ns11:limitInfo> </axis2ns11:LimitInfoHeader> </soapenv:Header> <soapenv:Body> <axis2ns11:records xmlns:axis2ns11=\"urn:partner.soap.sforce.com\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"sf:sObject\"> <sf:type xmlns:sf=\"urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com\">Account</sf:type> <sf:Id xmlns:sf=\"urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com\">001E0000002SFO2IAO</sf:Id> <sf:CreatedDate xmlns:sf=\"urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com\">2011-03-15T00:15:00.000Z</sf:CreatedDate> <sf:Id xmlns:sf=\"urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com\">001E0000002SFO2IAO</sf:Id> <sf:Name xmlns:sf=\"urn:sobject.partner.soap.sforce.com\">WSO2</sf:Name> </axis2ns11:records> </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> XML: to load a sample XML file JSON: to load a sample JSON file CSV: to load a sample CSV file with column names as the first record JSONSCHEMA: to load a WSO2 Data Mapper JSON schema CONNECTOR: to use Data Mapper with WSO2 EI Connectors. Connectors will contain JSON schemas for each operation that defines the message formats to which it will respond and expect. Therefore, when you integrate connectors in a project this Connector option searches through the workspace and find the available Connectors. Then, you can select the respective Connector in the operation, so that the related JSON schema will be loaded for the Data Mapper by the tool. Mapping configuration file \u00b6 This is a JavaScript file generated by looking at the diagram you draw in the Data Mapper Diagram Editor by connecting input elements to output elements. Every operation you define in the diagram gets converted to a JavaScript operation. Data Mapper Engine \u00b6 You need the following information to configure the Data Mapper Engine: Input message type Output message type Input schema Java Scripting API Output schema Mapping configuration At the runtime, the Data Mapper Engine gets the input message and the runtime variable map object and outputs the transformed message. The D ata Mapper Engine uses the J ava Scripting API, t o execute the mapping configuration. Therefore, if your runtime is JAVA 7, it uses the Rhino JS Engine and if your runtime is JAVA 8, it uses the Nashorn JS engine. When you use JAVA 7, there are several limitations in the Rhino engine that directly affects the Data mapper Engine. There are several functions that Rhino does not support. F or example, String object functions like startsWith() and endsWith() . Therefore, the Rhino engine may have limitations in executing those when using custom functions and operators. Using product-specific runtime variables \u00b6 Also, the Data Mapper engine allows you to use runtime product-specific variables in the mapping. The intermediate component should construct a map object containing runtime product-specific variables and send it to the Data Mapper Engine, thereby, when the mapping happens in the Data Mapper Engine, these variables become available. For example, the Data Mapper mediator provides properties like axis2/transport/synapse/axis2client/operation/. . In the Data Mapper diagram, you can use the Property operator and define the scope and the property name and use it in the mapping. Then, the Data Mapper mediator will identify the required properties to execute the mapping and populate a map with the required properties and will send it to the Data Mapper Engine. Data Mapper element and attribute types \u00b6 Following are the element and attribute types that are supported by the Data Mapper. {} - represents object elements [] - represents array elements \\<> - represents primitive field values A - represents XML attribute values Data Mapper operations \u00b6 The operations palette placed in the left-hand side of the WSO2 Data Mapping Diagram Editor displays t he operations that the Data Mapper supports as shown below . {width=\"900\" height=\"349\"} You can drag and drop these operations to the Editor area. There are six categories of operations as follows: Links Common Arithmetic Conditional Boolean Type Conversion String Links \u00b6 {width=\"24\"} Data Mapping Link: maps elements with other operators and elements. Common \u00b6 {width=\"24\"} Constant: defines String, number or boolean constant values. {width=\"24\"} Custom Function: defines custom functions to use in the mapping. {width=\"24\"} Properties: uses product-specific runtime variables. {width=\"24\"} Global Variable: instantiates global variables that you can access from anywhere. {width=\"24\"} Compare: compares two inputs in the mapping.

Type conversion \u00b6 {width=\"24\"} StringToNumber: converts a String value to number (\u201c0\u201d -> 0). {width=\"24\"} StringToBoolean: converts a String value to boolean (\u201ctrue\u201d -> true). {width=\"24\"} ToString: converts a number or a boolean value to String. String \u00b6 {width=\"24\"} Concat: concatenates two or more Strings. {width=\"24\"} Split: splits a String by a matching String value. {width=\"24\"} Uppercase: converts a String to uppercase letters. {width=\"24\"} Lowercase: converts a String to lowercase letters. {width=\"24\"} String Length: gets the length of the String. {width=\"24\"} StartsWith: checks whether a String starts with a specific value. (This is not supported in Java 7.) {width=\"24\"} EndsWith: checks whether String ends with a specific value. (This is not supported in Java 7.) {width=\"24\"} Substring: extracts a part of the String value. {width=\"24\"} Trim: removes white spaces from the beginning and end of a String. {width=\"24\"} Replace: replaces the first occurrence of a target String with another. {width=\"24\"} Match \u2013 check whether the input match with a (JS) Regular Expression Examples \u00b6 Example 1 - Creating a SOAP payload with namespaces \u00b6 This example creates a Salesforce login SOAP payload using a JSON payload. The login payload consists of XML namespaces. Even though the JSON payload does not contain any namespace information, the output JSON schema will be generated with XML namespace information using the provided SOAP payload. {width=\"900\" height=\"196\"} The sample input JSON payload is as follows. { \"name\":\"Watson\", \"password\":\"watson@123\" } The sample output XML is as follows. <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:urn=\"urn:enterprise.soap.sforce.com\" xmlns:soapenv=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/\"> <soapenv:Body> <urn:login> <urn:username><b>user@domain.com</b></urn:username> <urn:password><b>secret</b></urn:password> </urn:login> </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> Example 2 - M apping SOAP header elements \u00b6 This example demonstrates how to map SOAP header elements along with SOAP body elements to create a certain SOAP payload, by creating a Salesforce convertLead SOAP payload using a JSON payload. The Convert Lead SOAP payload needs mapping SOAP header information. E.g. <urn:sessionId>QwWsHJyTPW.1pd0_jXlNKOSU</urn:sessionId> {width=\"900\" height=\"400\"} The sample input JSON payload is as follows. { \"owner\":{ \"ID\":\"005D0000000nVYVIA2\", \"name\":\"Smith\", \"city\":\"CA\", \"code\":\"94041\", \"country\":\"US\" }, \"lead\":{ \"ID\":\"00QD000000FP14JMAT\", \"name\":\"Carl\", \"city\":\"NC\", \"code\":\"97788\", \"country\":\"US\" }, \"sendNotificationEmail\":\"true\", \"convertedStatus\":\"Qualified\", \"doNotCreateOpportunity\":\"true\", \"opportunityName\":\"Partner Opportunity\", \"overwriteLeadSource\":\"true\", \"sessionId\":\"QwWsHJyTPW.1pd0_jXlNKOSU\" } The sample o utput XML is as follows. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:urn=\"urn:enterprise.soap.sforce.com\" xmlns:soapenv=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/\"> <soapenv:Header> <urn:SessionHeader> <urn:sessionId>QwWsHJyTPW.1pd0_jXlNKOSU</urn:sessionId> </urn:SessionHeader> </soapenv:Header> <soapenv:Body> <urn:convertLead > <urn:leadConverts> <!-- Zero or more repetitions --> <urn:convertedStatus>Qualified</urn:convertedStatus> <urn:doNotCreateOpportunity>false</urn:doNotCreateOpportunity> <urn:leadId>00QD000000FP14JMAT</urn:leadId> <urn:opportunityName>Partner Opportunity</urn:opportunityName> <urn:overwriteLeadSource>true</urn:overwriteLeadSource> <urn:ownerId>005D0000000nVYVIA2</urn:ownerId> <urn:sendNotificationEmail>true</urn:sendNotificationEmail> </urn:leadConverts> </urn:convertLead> </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> Example 3 - Mapping primitive types \u00b6 This example demonstrates how you can map an XML payload with integer, boolean etc. values, into a JSON payload with required primitive types, by specifying the required primitive type in the JSON schema. {width=\"900\"} The sample input XML payload is as follows. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <name>app_name</name> <version>version</version> <manifest_version>2</manifest_version> <description>description_text</description> <container>GOOGLE_DRIVE</container> <api_console_project_id>YOUR_APP_ID</api_console_project_id> <gdrive_mime_types> <http://drive.google.com/intents/opendrivedoc> <type>image/png</type> <type>image/jpeg</type> <type>image/gif</type> <type>application/vnd.google.drive.ext-type.png</type> <type>application/vnd.google.drive.ext-type.jpg</type> <type>application/vnd.google.drive.ext-type.gif</type> <href>http://your_web_url/</href> <title>Open</title> <disposition>window</disposition> </http://drive.google.com/intents/opendrivedoc> </gdrive_mime_types> <icons> <128>icon_128.png</128> </icons> <app> <launch> <web_url>http://yoursite.com</web_url> </launch> </app> The sample o utput JSON is as follows. { \"name\" : \"app_name\", \"version\" : \"version\", \"manifest_version\" : 2, \"description\" : \"description_text\", \"container\" : \"GOOGLE_DRIVE\", \"api_console_project_id\" : \"YOUR_APP_ID\", \"gdrive_mime_types\": { \"http://drive.google.com/intents/opendrivedoc\": [ { \"type\": [\"image/png\", \"image/jpeg\", \"image/gif\", \"application/vnd.google.drive.ext-type.png\", \"application/vnd.google.drive.ext-type.jpg\",\"application/vnd.google.drive.ext-type.gif\"], \"href\": \"http://your_web_url/\", \"title\" : \"Open\", \"disposition\" : \"window\" } ] }, \"icons\": { \"128\": \"icon_128.png\" }, \"app\" : { \"launch\" : { \"web_url\" : \"http://yoursite.com\" } } } Example 4 - Mapping XML to CSV \u00b6 This example demonstrates how you can map an XML payload to CSV format. Info If you specify special characters (e.g., & , &amp; ) within the <text> tag w hen converting from CSV to CSV , they will be displayed as follows by default. & -> &amp; &amp; -> &amp;amp; < -> &lt; &lt; -> &lt;lt; To avoid this and to display the exact special characters as text in the returned output, add the following properties in the Synapse configuration. <property name=\"messageType\" value=\"text/plain\" scope=\"axis2\"/> <property name=\"ContentType\" value=\"text/plain\" scope=\"axis2\"/> {width=\"900\" height=\"217\"} The sample in put XML payload is as follows. <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <PurchaseOrder PurchaseOrderNumber=\"001\"> <Address> <Name>James Yee</Name> <Street>Downtown Bartow</Street> <City>Old Town</City> <State>PA</State> <Zip>95819</Zip> <Country>USA</Country> </Address> <Address> <Name>Elen Smith</Name> <Street>123 Maple Street</Street> <City>Mill Valley</City> <State>CA</State> <Zip>10999</Zip> <Country>USA</Country> </Address> <DeliveryNotes>Please leave packages in shed by driveway.</DeliveryNotes> </PurchaseOrder> The sample out put CSV is as follows.

W hen operating in this mode, i t can filter, transform, drop or forward messages to an endpoint based on the given parameters. A unit of the mediation flow is a mediator. Sequences define the message mediation behavior of the ESB profile. A sequence is a series of mediators, where each mediator is a unit entity that can input a message, carry out a predefined processing task on the message, and output the message for further processing. What is debugging with respect to mediation Instant debugging using Micro Integrator Debugging with external WSO2 EI server Creating the artifact Enabling mediation debugging Information provided by the Debugger Tool Changing the property values Viewing wire logs What is debugging with respect to mediation \u00b6 Debugging is where you want to know if these units, which function as separate entities are operating as intended, or if a combination of these units are operating as a whole as intended. The ESB profile packs the Mediation debugger that enables you to debug the ESB profile message mediation flow in the server. Tooling support for the Mediation debugger is provided by the WSO2 Integration Studio Plugin which comes out of the box with WSO2 Integration Studio. First f ollow the steps below to create a sample the ESB profile artifact, which you will debug . Install the plugin and run it. For instructions, see Installing WSO2 Integration Studio . Create the ESB profile artifact using the WSO2 Integration Studio . For instructions, see WSO2 Integration Studio . There are two ways to debug a developed mediation flow. Instant debugging using Micro Integrator ( a light version of ESB profile) packaged with WSO2 Integration Studio. Deploy artifacts to an external WSO2 EI server and debug Above two approaches are discussed in detail below. Instant debugging using Micro Integrator \u00b6 When project artifacts are ready, on the project panel select the project you want to debug and click on Run > Debug . {width=\"200\"} It will ask to choose the artifacts those needs to be deployed to Embedded Micro EI server. Internally WSO2 Integration Studio will generate a CAR application with choosed artifacts and deploy. {width=\"500\"} On the console of WSO2 Integration Sturdio, notice that Micro Integrator is started with artifacts deployed. HTTP traffic is listened on 8290 port. Add some breakpoints in the flow as below. You can mark a particular mediator as a breakpoint. {width=\"800\"} Invoke the service using SOAP UI or some external client. As soon as a request comes to the proxy service fisrt brak point will hit. {width=\"800\" height=\"431\"} Note that you can view the payload that comes into the mediator and the properties that you can access on the message context. Click on \" Continue \" button. Then the message will be sent to the backend by call mediator and next breakpoint, the log mediator will hit. {width=\"800\" height=\"424\"} Note that response can be viewed on Message Envelope tab. The property set before calling the endpoint is also accessible in the context. Click on \" Continue \" button again. Response will be received by the client. {width=\"800\"} Debugging with external WSO2 EI server \u00b6 Creating the artifact \u00b6 Deploy the artifact you created on the ESB profile. For instructions, see Packaging your Artifacts into Composite Applications . Enabling mediation debugging \u00b6 Follow the steps below to enable debugging with respect to mediation. Click Run in the top menu of the WSO2 Integration Studio, and then click Debug Configurations . {width=\"200\"} Enter the details to create a new configuration as shown in the example below. You need to define two port numbers and a hostname t o connect the ESB profile with WSO2 Integration Studio in the mediation debug mode. Note that you need to specify debug mode as Remote . {width=\"500\"} Add the new configuration to debug menu as below. Then you can access the configuation easily. {width=\"500\"} Execute the following commands to s tart WSO2 EI server in the debug mode by passing a system variable at start up: On Windows: <EI_HOME>\\bin\\integrator.bat --run -Desb.debug=true On Linux/Solaris: sh <EI_HOME>/bin/ integrator .sh -Desb.debug=true Click downward arrow beside Debug in the WSO2 Integration Studio, and select the new profile above created when the Console indicates the following. !!! note You have approximately a one-minute time span to connect WSO2 Integration Studio with the EI server for the execution of the above created debug configuration. Otherwise, the EI server will stop listening and start without connecting with the debugger tool. {width=\"900\"} {width=\"200\"} In WSO2 Integration Studio, r ight-click and add breakpoints or skip points on the desired mediators to start debugging as shown in the example below. {height=\"250\"} !!! info You can add the following debugging options on the mediators using the right click context menu. - **Toggle Breakpoint:** Adds a breakpoint to the selected mediator - **Toggle Skip Point:** Adds a skip point to the selected mediator - **Resend EI Debug Points:** I f you re-start the the ESB profile, or i f you re-deploy the proxy service after changing its Synapse configuration, you need to re-send the information on breakpoints to the WSO2 EI server. T his re-s ends all registered debugging points to the EI Server. - **Delete All EI Debug Points:** Deletes all registered debug points from the EI Server and WSO2 Integration Studio. Now you can send a request to the external WSO2 EI server and debug the flow as discussed under \"Instant debugging using Micro Integrator\". Information provided by the Debugger Tool \u00b6 When your target artifact gets a request message and when the mediation flow reaches a mediator marked as a breakpoint, the message mediation process suspends at that point. A tool tip message of the suspended mediator displays the message envelope of the message payload at that point as shown in the example below . {width=\"650\"} You can view the message payload at that point of the message flow also in the Message Envelope tab as shown below. {width=\"650\"} Also, you can view the message mediation properties in the Variables view as shown in the example below. The Variable view contains properties of the following property scopes. Axis2-Client Scope Properties Axis2 Scope Properties Operation Scope Properties Synapse Scope Properties Transport Scope Properties You can have a list of selected properties out of the above, in the properties table of the Message Envelope tab, and view information on the property keys and values of them as shown below. {width=\"650\"} Click Add Property , specify the context and name of the property, and then click OK , to add that property to the properties table in the Message Envelope tab as shown below. Tip Click Clear Property , to remove a property from the properties table. {width=\"650\"} Changing the property values \u00b6 There are three operations that you can perform on message mediation property values as described below. Injecting new properties \u00b6 Follow the steps below to inject new properties to the ESB profile while debugging. Right click on the Variable view, click Inject/Clear Property , and then click Inject Property as shown below. {width=\"650\"} Enter the details about the property you prefer to add as shown in the example below. {width=\"500\"} Click OK . When the next debug point is hit, you will see the property is set to the specified context. {height=\"250\"} Clearing a property \u00b6 Follow the steps below to c lear an existing property from the the ESB profile. Right click on the Variable view, click Inject/Clear Property , and then click Clear Property as shown below. {width=\"650\"} Enter the details about the property you want to clear as shown in the example below. {width=\"500\"} Click OK . Modifying a property \u00b6 Click on the value section of the preferred property and change the value in the Variable view as shown in the example below, to modify it . {width=\"650\"} You will see the property is changed on the property view. {width=\"650\"} Viewing wire logs \u00b6 While debugging a Synapse flow, you can view the the actual HTTP messages at the entry point of the ESB profile via wire logs. For example, you can view wire logs of the incoming flow and the final response of a proxy service. Also, you can view wire logs for points, where it goes out from the ESB profile. For example, you can see the outgoing and incoming wire logs for specific mediators (i.e. Call mediator, Send mediator etc.). Wire logs are useful to troubleshoot unexpected issues, which occurr while integrating miscallaneous systems. You can use wire logs to verify whether the message payload is properly going out from the server, whether the HTTP headers such as the content-type is properly set in the outgoing message etc. Note It is recommended to enable wire logs only for troubleshooting purposes. Running productions systems with wire logs enabled is not recommended. Enabling wire logs \u00b6 The passthrough HTTP transport is the main transport, which handles HTTP/HTTPS messages in WSO2 EI. Un-comment the following entry in the <EI_HOME/conf/log4j.properties file to enable wire logs for the passthrough HTTP transport: log4j.logger.org.apache.synapse.transport.http.wire=DEBUG Info Callout mediator uses the Axis2 CommonsHTTPSender to invoke services. It does not leverage the non-blocking NHTTP/passthrough transports. Therefore, you need to add the following entries to the <EI_HOME/conf/log4j.properties file to enable wire logs for the callout mediator. log4j.logger.httpclient.wire.header=DEBUG log4j.logger.httpclient.wire.content=DEBUG Following is a sample wirelog.

A mediator can take a message, carry out some predefined actions on it, and output the modified message. For example, the Clone mediator splits a message into several clones, the Send mediator sends the messages, and the Aggregate mediator collects and merges the responses before sending them back to the client. The ESB profile ships with a range of mediators capable of carrying out various tasks on input messages, including functionality to match incompatible protocols, data formats and interaction patterns across different resources. Data can be split, cloned, aggregated, and enriched, allowing the ESB profile to match the different capabilities of services. XQuery and XSLT allow rich transformations on the messages. Rule-based message mediation allows users to cope with the uncertainty of business logic. Content-based routing using XPath filtering is supported in different flavors, allowing users to get the most convenient configuration experience. Built-in capability to handle Transactions allows message mediation to be done transactionally inside the ESB profile . With the eventing capabilities of the ESB profile , EDA based components can be easily interconnected, allowing the ESB profile to be used in the front-end of an organisation's SOA infrastructure. A mediator is a full-powered processing unit in the ESB profile of WSO2 EI. At run-time, a mediator has access to all the parts of the ESB profile along with the current message and can do virtually anything with the message. At the run-time, a message is injected in to the mediator with the ESB profile information. Then this mediator can do virtually anything with the message. A user can write a mediator and put it into the ESB profile . This custom mediator and any other built-in mediator will be exactly the same as the API and the privileges (Refer to more information in Creating Custom Mediators ). A mediation sequence , commonly called a \"sequence\", is a list of mediators. That means, it can hold other mediators and execute them. It is part of the ESB profile 's core and message mediation cannot live without this mediator. When a message is delivered to a sequence, it sends the message through all its child mediators. For more information, see Mediation Sequences . The Process of message mediation is depicted in the diagram below. {width=\"600\"} In case an error occurs in the main sequence while processing, the message goes to the fault sequence. {width=\"600\"} When adding a mediator to a sequence , you can configure the mediator in design view or in source view. Usually, a mediator is configured using XML. Source view provides the XML representation of the configurations done in the UI. When you edit the source XML all changes immediately reflect in the design view as well. Each mediator has its own XML configuration. You can change the following mediators using their source view: Aggregate Mediator Cache Mediator Filter Mediator In Mediator Iterate Mediator Out Mediator Sequence Mediator Synapse Mediator Template Mediator Validate Mediator Tip It is possible to comment out lines of code in the Synapse definition as well as in the source view of the complete EI configuration. Mediators in a sequence can be one of the following types: Node mediators - Contains child mediators. Leaf mediators - Does not hold any other child mediators. Mediators are classified as follows based on whether or not they access the message's content: Content-aware mediators : These mediators always access the message content when mediating messages (e.g., Enrich mediator ). Content-unaware mediators : These mediators never access the message content when mediating messages (e.g., Send mediator ). Conditionally content-aware mediators : These mediators could be either content-aware or content-unaware depending on their exact instance configuration. For an example a simple Log Mediator instance (i.e. configured as <log/> ) is content-unaware. However a log mediator configured as <log level=\u201dfull\u201d/> would be content-aware since it is expected to log the message payload. Mediators are considered to be one of the main mechanisms for extending an EI. You can create custom mediators and add them to the ESB profile . This custom mediator and any other built-in mediator will be exactly the same as the API and the privileges. The standard mediators in the ESB profile are listed in the table below.

A mediator can take a message, carry out some predefined actions on it, and output the modified message. For example, the Clone mediator splits a message into several clones, the Send mediator sends the messages, and the Aggregate mediator collects and merges the responses before sending them back to the client. The ESB profile ships with a range of mediators capable of carrying out various tasks on input messages, including functionality to match incompatible protocols, data formats and interaction patterns across different resources. Data can be split, cloned, aggregated, and enriched, allowing the ESB profile to match the different capabilities of services. XQuery and XSLT allow rich transformations on the messages. Rule-based message mediation allows users to cope with the uncertainty of business logic. Content-based routing using XPath filtering is supported in different flavors, allowing users to get the most convenient configuration experience. Built-in capability to handle Transactions allows message mediation to be done transactionally inside the ESB profile . With the eventing capabilities of the ESB profile , EDA based components can be easily interconnected, allowing the ESB profile to be used in the front-end of an organisation's SOA infrastructure. A mediator is a full-powered processing unit in the ESB profile of WSO2 EI.

Instructions for use \u00b6 Select the configuration sections, parameters, and values that are required for your use and add them to the .toml file. See the example .toml file given below. # This is an example .toml file. [server] pattern=\"value\" enable_port_forward=true [[custom_transport.listener]] class=\"value\" protocol = \"value\" Configuring the default deployment settings [server] Required This toml header groups the parameters that are used for identifying a server node. You need need to update these values when you set up a deployment . hostname string Required \"localhost\" The hostname of the WSO2 EI server instance. node_ip string Required \"10.100.1.80\" The IP address of the server node. enable_mtom boolean false Use this paramater to enable MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) for the product server. enable_swa boolean false Use this paramater to enable SwA (SOAP with Attachments) for the product server. When SwA is enabled, the ESB will process the files attached to SOAP messages. offset integer 0 Port offset allows you to run multiple WSO2 products, multiple instances of a WSO2 product, or multiple WSO2 product clusters on the same server or virtual machine (VM). Port offset defines the number by which all ports defined in the runtime such as the HTTP/S ports will be offset. For example, if the default HTTP port is 9443 and the portOffset is 1, the effective HTTP port will be 9444. Therefore, for each additional WSO2 product instance, set the port offset to a unique value (the default is 0) so that they can all run on the same server without any port conflicts. [server] hostname=\"localhost\" node_ip = \"10.100.1.80\" base_path = \"127.0.0.1\" enable_mtom=false enable_swa=false userAgent = \"WSO2 ${product.key} ${product.version}\" serverDetails = \"WSO2 ${product.key} ${product.version}\" offset = 0 proxy_context_path = \"\" Configuring the cluster settings [clustering] Required This config heading groups the parameters that connects the server to a clustered deployment . members string Required [\"10.100.5.86:4000\",\"10.100.5.86:4001\"] Specify the well-known members in the cluster in both nodes as shown below. For example, when you configure one ESB node, you need to specify the other nodes in the cluster as well-known members as shown below. The port value for the WKA node must be the same value as it's localMemberPort (in this case it is 4000). Note You can also use IP address ranges for the hostname (e.g., 192.168.1.2-10). However, you can define a range only for the last portion of the IP address. Smaller the range, faster the time it takes to discover members since each node has to scan a lesser number of potential members. The best practice is to add all the members (including itself) in all the nodes to avoid any conflicts in configurations. local_member_port integer Required 4000 The port that is assigned to the server node in the deployment. Note This port number is not affected by the port offset value specified under the [server] section. If this port number is already assigned to another server, the clustering framework automatically increments this port number. However, if there are two servers running on the same machine, ensure that a unique port is set for each server. For example, you can have port 4000 for node 1 and port 4001 for node 2. local_member_host string Required \"10.100.5.86\" The hostname of the server node. When you have multiple nodes in the deployment, this hostname will be used to identify the node during inter-node communications. membership_scheme string 'wka' Add this parameter to change the default membership scheme. By default, the well-known address registration method (WKA) is used, which ensures that each node sends cluster initiation messages to the WKA members. domain string \"wso2.carbon.domain\" Add this parameter to change the default cluster (domain name) to which the server node joins. By default, wso2.carbon.domain is set.

If there are too many active connections in the connection pool, some of them would be idle, which incurs an unnecessary system overhead. Depending on your environment, enter any negative value to denote an unlimited number of active connections. max_wait integer \"6000\" The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no available connections) for a connection to be returned before throwing an exception. Depending on your environment, enter zero or a negative value to wait indefinitely. test_on_borrow boolean true true , false Determines whether objects are validated before being borrowed from the pool. If the object fails to validate, it will be dropped from the pool, and another attempt will be made to borrow another. validation_interval integer \"30000\" Connections are validated (at the most) at this frequency (time in milliseconds). If a connection is due for validation but has been validated previously within this interval, it will not be validated again. This avoids access validation. default_auto_commit boolean true true , false Specifies whether each SQL statement should be automatically committed when the operation is completed. It is recommended to disable auto committing.

You may sometimes choose to configure a separate keystore for this purpose because the primary keystore that is used by the [keystore.tls] configuration needs to renew certificates frequently. However, for encrypting information in internal data stores, the keystore certificates should not be changed frequently because the data that is already encrypted will become unusable every time the certificate changes.

These parameters are mainly used when mediators such as Iterate and Clone (which leverage on internal thread pools) are used. synapse.core_threads integer \"20\" The initial number of synapse threads in the pool. This parameter is applicable only if the Iterate or the Clone mediator is used to handle a higher load. The number of threads specified for this parameter should be increased as required to balance an increased load. synapse.max_threads integer \"100\" The maximum number of synapse threads in the pool. This parameter is applicable only if the Iterate or the Clone mediator is used to handle a higher load. The number of threads specified for this parameter should be increased as required to balance an increased load. synapse.threads_queue_length integer \"10\" The length of the queue that is used to hold the runnable tasks to be executed by the pool. This parameter is applicable only if the Iterate or the Clone mediator is used to handle a higher load. synapse.global_timeout_interval_millis integer \"120000\" The maximum number of milliseconds within which a response for the request should be received. A response which arrives after the specified number of seconds cannot be correlated with the request. Hence, a warning all be logged and the request will be dropped. This parameter is also referred to as the time-out handler. synapse.enable_xpath_dom_failover boolean true If this parameter is set to true , it will be possible for ESB to switch to xpath 2.0. The default value for this parameter is false since xpath 2.0 evaluations can cause performance degradation. Warning WSO2 EI uses the Saxon Home Edition in implementing XPATH 2.0 functionalities, and thus supports all the functions that are shipped with it.

This supports XACML 2.0 and 3.0. WSO2 Identity Server can be used as the XACML Policy Decision Point (PDP) where the policy is set, and the ESB profile of WSO2 EI serves as the XACML Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) where the policy is enforced.

These sub elements are used to define a mediation sequence to be applied based on the entitlement result. The following are descriptions for the four sub elements of the Entitlement mediator. Parameter Name Description OnAccept The sequence to execute when the result returned by the Entitlement mediator is Permit . For example, you can configure the sequence to direct the request to the back end server as requested. OnReject The sequence to execute when the result returned by the Entitlement mediator is Deny , Not Applicable or Indeterminate . For example, you can configure the sequence to respond to the client with the message Unauthorized Request. Obligations The sequence to execute when the XACML response contains an obligation statement. When this response is received, the Entitlement mediator clones the current message context, creates a new message context, adds the obligation statement to the SOAP body and then executes the sequence. Since the Obligations sequence is executed synchronously, the Entitlement mediator waits for a response. If the sequence returns a true value, the sequence defined for the OnAccept sub element is applied. If the sequence returns a false value, the sequence defined for the OnReject sub element is applied. Advice The sequence to execute when the XACML response contains an advice statement. When this response is received, the Entitlement mediator clones the current message context, creates a new message context, adds the advice statement to the SOAP body and then executes the sequence. Since the Advice sequence is executed asynchronously, the Entitlement mediator does not wait for a response. The Entitlement mediator configuration screen appears below the tree as shown below. The parameters available for configuring the Entitlement mediator are as follows. Parameter Name Description Entitlement Server Server URL of the WSO2 Identity Server that acts as the PDP (e.g., https://localhost:9443/services ). User Name This user should have permissions to log in and manage configurations in the WSO2 Identity Server. Password The password of the username entered in the User Name parameter. Entitlement Callback Handler The handler that should be used to get the subject (user name) for the XACML request. !!! tip You need to secure the proxy service , which uses the Entitlement mediator using one of the following methods and select the Entitlement Callback Handler based on the method you used. UT : This class looks for the subject name in the Axis2 message context under the username property. This is useful when the UsernameToken security is enabled in the ESB profile for a proxy service, because when the user is authenticated for such a proxy service, the username would be set in the Axis2 message context. As a result, the Entitlement mediator would automatically get the subject value for the XACML request from there. This is the default callback class. X509 : Specify this class if the proxy is secured with X509 certificates. SAML : Specify this class if the proxy is secured with WS-Trust. Kerberos : Specify this class if the proxy is secured with Kerberos. Custom : This allows you to specify a custom entitlement callback handler class. !!! info You can also set properties that control how the subject is retrieved; see Advanced Callback Properties . Entitlement Service Client The method of communication to use between the PEP and the PDP. For SOAP, choose whether to use Basic Authentication (available with WSO2 Identify Server 4.0.0 and later) OR the AuthenticationAdmin service, which authenticates with the Entitlement service in Identity Server 3.2.3 and earlier. Thrift uses its own authentication service over TCP. WS-XACML uses Basic Authentication. !!! info The XAMCL standard refrains from specifying which method should be used to communicate from the PEP to the PDP, and many vendors have implemented a proprietary approach. There is a standard called \u201cWeb Services Profile of XACML (WS-XACML) Version 1.0\u2033, but it has not been widely adopted because of its bias toward SOAP and the performance implications from XML signatures. However, the benefit of adopting a standard is the elimination of vendor locking, because it will allow your current PEP to work even if you move to a PDP from another vendor (as long as the new PDP also supports this standard). Otherwise you may need to modify your existing PEP to adopt to the new PDP. WSO2 Identity Server has its proprietary SOAP API, Thrift API, and basic support for WS-XACML. Thrift Host The host used to establish a Thrift connection with the Entitlement service when the Entitlement Service Client is set to Thrift. Thrift Port The port used to establish a Thrift connection with the Entitlement service when the Entitlement Service Client is set to Thrift. The default port is 10500. You will now define the sequences you want to run for the entitlement results. If you want to specify an existing sequence for a result, click Referring Sequence for that result and select the sequence from the registry. If you want to define the sequence in the tree, leave In-Lined Sequence selected. Click Update . In the tree, click the first result node for which you want to define the sequence, and then add the appropriate mediators to create the sequence. Repeat for each result node. Example \u00b6 In the following example, the WSO2 Identity Server (with log in URL https://localhost:9443/service s) is see to authenticate the user invoking the secured backend service.

These sub elements are used to define a mediation sequence to be applied based on the entitlement result. The following are descriptions for the four sub elements of the Entitlement mediator. Parameter Name Description OnAccept The sequence to execute when the result returned by the Entitlement mediator is Permit . For example, you can configure the sequence to direct the request to the back end server as requested. OnReject The sequence to execute when the result returned by the Entitlement mediator is Deny , Not Applicable or Indeterminate . For example, you can configure the sequence to respond to the client with the message Unauthorized Request. Obligations The sequence to execute when the XACML response contains an obligation statement. When this response is received, the Entitlement mediator clones the current message context, creates a new message context, adds the obligation statement to the SOAP body and then executes the sequence. Since the Obligations sequence is executed synchronously, the Entitlement mediator waits for a response. If the sequence returns a true value, the sequence defined for the OnAccept sub element is applied. If the sequence returns a false value, the sequence defined for the OnReject sub element is applied. Advice The sequence to execute when the XACML response contains an advice statement. When this response is received, the Entitlement mediator clones the current message context, creates a new message context, adds the advice statement to the SOAP body and then executes the sequence. Since the Advice sequence is executed asynchronously, the Entitlement mediator does not wait for a response. The Entitlement mediator configuration screen appears below the tree as shown below. The parameters available for configuring the Entitlement mediator are as follows. Parameter Name Description Entitlement Server Server URL of the WSO2 Identity Server that acts as the PDP (e.g., https://localhost:9443/services ). User Name This user should have permissions to log in and manage configurations in the WSO2 Identity Server. Password The password of the username entered in the User Name parameter. Entitlement Callback Handler The handler that should be used to get the subject (user name) for the XACML request. !!! tip You need to secure the proxy service , which uses the Entitlement mediator using one of the following methods and select the Entitlement Callback Handler based on the method you used. UT : This class looks for the subject name in the Axis2 message context under the username property. This is useful when the UsernameToken security is enabled in the ESB profile for a proxy service, because when the user is authenticated for such a proxy service, the username would be set in the Axis2 message context. As a result, the Entitlement mediator would automatically get the subject value for the XACML request from there. This is the default callback class. X509 : Specify this class if the proxy is secured with X509 certificates. SAML : Specify this class if the proxy is secured with WS-Trust. Kerberos : Specify this class if the proxy is secured with Kerberos. Custom : This allows you to specify a custom entitlement callback handler class. !!! info You can also set properties that control how the subject is retrieved; see Advanced Callback Properties . Entitlement Service Client The method of communication to use between the PEP and the PDP. For SOAP, choose whether to use Basic Authentication (available with WSO2 Identify Server 4.0.0 and later) OR the AuthenticationAdmin service, which authenticates with the Entitlement service in Identity Server 3.2.3 and earlier. Thrift uses its own authentication service over TCP. WS-XACML uses Basic Authentication. !!! info The XAMCL standard refrains from specifying which method should be used to communicate from the PEP to the PDP, and many vendors have implemented a proprietary approach. There is a standard called \u201cWeb Services Profile of XACML (WS-XACML) Version 1.0\u2033, but it has not been widely adopted because of its bias toward SOAP and the performance implications from XML signatures. However, the benefit of adopting a standard is the elimination of vendor locking, because it will allow your current PEP to work even if you move to a PDP from another vendor (as long as the new PDP also supports this standard). Otherwise you may need to modify your existing PEP to adopt to the new PDP. WSO2 Identity Server has its proprietary SOAP API, Thrift API, and basic support for WS-XACML. Thrift Host The host used to establish a Thrift connection with the Entitlement service when the Entitlement Service Client is set to Thrift. Thrift Port The port used to establish a Thrift connection with the Entitlement service when the Entitlement Service Client is set to Thrift. The default port is 10500. You will now define the sequences you want to run for the entitlement results. If you want to specify an existing sequence for a result, click Referring Sequence for that result and select the sequence from the registry.

The result is a faster transformation, but you cannot specify the source, properties, features, or resources as you can with the XSLT mediator. Therefore, the FastXSLT mediator is intended to be used to gain performance in cases where the original message remains unmodified. Any pre-processing performed on the message payload will not be visible to the FastXSLT mediator, because the transformation logic is applied on the original message stream instead of the message payload. In cases where the message payload needs to be pre-processed, use the XSLT mediator instead of the FastXSLT mediator. Note The streaming XPath parser used in the Fast XSLT mediator does not support Xpath functions specified with the prefix \" fn: \". Examples are \" fn:contains \", \" fn:count \", and \" fn:concat \". For example, if you are using the VFS transport to handle files, you might want to read the content of the file as a stream and directly send the content for XSLT transformation. If you need to pre-process the message payload, such as adding or removing properties, use the XSLT mediator instead. In summary, following are the key differences between the XSLT and FastXSLT mediators: XSLT Mediator FastXSLT Mediator Performs XSLT transformations on the message payload .

It splits the message into a number of different messages derived from the original message by finding matching elements for the XPath expression specified. Based on the matching elements, new messages are created for each iteration and processed sequentially. The processing is carried out based on a specified sequence. The behaviour of ForEach mediator is similar to a generic loop. After mediation, the sub-messages are merged back to their original parent element in the original message sequentially. The ForEach mediator creates the following properties during mediation. Property Description FOREACH_ORIGINAL_MESSAGE This contains the original envelop of the messages split by the ForEach mediator. FOREACH_COUNTER This contains the count of the messages processed. The message count increases during each iteration. Note Iterate Mediator is quite similar to the ForEach mediator. You can use complex XPath expressions to conditionally select elements to iterate over in both mediators. Following are the main difference between ForEach and Iterate mediators: Use the ForEach mediator only for message transformations. If you need to make back-end calls from each iteration, then use the iterate mediator. ForEach supports modifying the original payload. You can use Iterate for situations where you send the split messages to a target and collect them by an Aggregate in a different flow You need to always accompany an Iterate with an Aggregate mediator. ForEach loops over the sub-messages and merges them back to the same parent element of the message. In Iterate you need to send the split messages to an endpoint to continue the message flow. However, ForEach does not allow using Call , Send and Callout mediators in the sequence. ForEach does not split the message flow, unlike Iterate Mediator. It guarantees to execute in the same thread until all iterations are complete. When you use ForEach mediator, you can only loop through segments of the message and do changes to a particular segment. For example, you can change the payload using payload factory mediator. But you cannot send the split message out to a service. Once you exit from the ForEach loop, it automatically aggregates the split segments. This replaces the ForEach function of the complex XSLT mediators using a ForEach mediator and a Payload Factory mediator.

PRESERVE_WS_ADDRESSING \u00b6 Name PRESERVE_WS_ADDRESSING Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior none Scope synapse Description By default, the ESB profile adds a new set of WS-Addressing headers to the messages forwarded from the ESB profile. If this property is set to \" true \" on a message, the ESB profile will forward it without altering its existing WS-Addressing headers. Example <property name= \"PRESERVE_WS_ADDRESSING\" value= \"true\" /> RESPONSE \u00b6 Name RESPONSE Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior none Scope synapse Description Once this property is set to 'true' on a message, the ESB profile will start treating it as a response message. It is generally used to route a request message back to its source as the response. Example <property name= \"RESPONSE\" value= \"true\" /> OUT_ONLY \u00b6 Name OUT_ONLY Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior none Scope synapse Description Set this property to \"true\" on a message to indicate that no response message is expected for it once it is forwarded from the ESB profile. In other words, the ESB profile will do an out-only invocation with such messages. It is very important to set this property on messages that are involved in out-only invocations to prevent the ESB profile from registering unnecessary callbacks for response handling and eventually running out of memory. Description for value=\"true\" Set this property to \"true\" on a message to indicate that no response message is expected for it once it is forwarded from the ESB profile. In other words, the ESB profile will do an out-only invocation with such messages. It is very important to set this property on messages that are involved in out-only invocations to prevent the ESB profile from registering unnecessary callbacks for response handling and eventually running out of memory. <property name= \"OUT_ONLY\" value= \"true\" /> Description for value=\"false\" Set this property to \"false\" to call the endpoint and get a response once it is forwarded from the ESB. <property name= \"OUT_ONLY\" value= \"false\" /> ERROR_CODE \u00b6 Name ERROR_CODE Possible Values string Default Behavior none Scope synapse Description Use this property to set a custom error code on a message which can be later processed by a Synapse fault handler. If the Synapse encounters an error during mediation or routing, this property will be automatically populated. Example <property name= \"ERROR_CODE\" value= \"100100\" /> ERROR_MESSAGE \u00b6 Name ERROR_MESSAGE Possible Values string Default Behavior none Scope synapse Description Use this property to set a custom error message on a message which can be later processed by a Synapse fault handler.

Example <log level= \"custom\" > <property name= \"Trace\" expression= \"get-property('ERROR_DETAIL')\" /> </log> ERROR_EXCEPTION \u00b6 Name ERROR_EXCEPTION Possible Values java.lang.Exception Default Behavior none Scope synapse Description Contains the actual exception thrown in case of a runtime error. TRANSPORT_HEADERS \u00b6 Name TRANSPORT_HEADERS Possible Values java.util.Map Default Behavior Populated with the transport headers of the incoming request. Scope axis2 Description Contains the map of transport headers. Automatically populated. Individual values of this map can be accessed using the property mediator in the transport scope. Example <property name= \"TRANSPORT_HEADERS\" action= \"remove\" scope= \"axis2\" /> messageType \u00b6 Name messageType Possible Values string Default Behavior Content type of incoming request. Scope axis2 Description Message formatter is selected based on this property. This property should have the content type, such as text/xml, application/xml, or application/json. Example <property name= \"messageType\" value= \"text/xml\" scope= \"axis2\" /> ContentType \u00b6 Name ContentType Possible Values string Default Behavior Value of the Content-type header of the incoming request. Scope axis2 Description This property will be in effect only if the messageType property is set. If the messageType is set, the value of Content-Type HTTP header of the outgoing request will be chosen based on this property. Note that this property is required to be set only if the message formatter seeks it in the message formatter implementation. Example <property name= \"ContentType\" value= \"text/xml\" scope= \"axis2\" /> disableAddressingForOutMessages \u00b6 Name disableAddressingForOutMessages Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior false Scope axis2 Description Set this property to \"true\" if you do not want the ESB profile to add WS-Addressing headers to outgoing messages. This property can affect messages sent to backend services as well as the responses routed back to clients. Example <property name= \"disableAddressingForOutMessages\" value= \"true\" scope= \"axis2\" /> DISABLE_SMOOKS_RESULT_PAYLOAD \u00b6 Name DISABLE_SMOOKS_RESULT_PAYLOAD Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior false Scope synapse Description If this property is set to true , the result of file content processing carried out by the Smooks Mediator will not be loaded into the message context. This is useful in situations where you want to avoid large memory growth/out of heap space issue that may occur when large files processed by the Smooks mediator are reprocessed. See VFS Transport for a proxy service configuration where this property is used. Example <property name= \"DISABLE_SMOOKS_RESULT_PAYLOAD\" value= \"true\" scope= \"default\" type= \"STRING\" /> ClientApiNonBlocking \u00b6 Name ClientApiNonBlocking Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior true Scope axis2 Description By default, Axis2 spawns a new thread to handle each outgoing message. This property holds the primary thread until a VFS proxy writes to a VFS endpoint. You need to r emove this property from the message to change this behavior when queuing transports like JMS are involved. Example <property name= \"ClientApiNonBlocking\" action= \"remove\" scope= \"axis2\" /> transportNonBlocking \u00b6 Name transportNonBlocking Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior true Scope axis2 Description This property works the same way as ClientApiNonBlocking . It is recommended to use ClientApiNonBlocking for this purpose instead of transportNonBlocking since the former uses the latest axis2 translations. Example <property name= \"transportNonBlocking\" action= \"remove\" scope= \"axis2\" value= \"true\" /> TRANSPORT_IN_NAME \u00b6 Name TRANSPORT_IN_NAME Scope synapse Description Mediation logic can read incoming transport name using this property (since WSO2 ESB 4.7.0) Example <log level= \"custom\" > <property name= \"INCOMING_TRANSPORT\" expression= \"get-property('TRANSPORT_IN_NAME')\" /> </log> preserveProcessedHeaders \u00b6 Name preserveProcessedHeaders Possible Values \"true\", \"false\" Default Behavior Preserving SOAP headers Scope synapse(default) Description By default, Synapse removes the SOAP headers of incoming requests that have been processed. If we set this property to 'true', Synapse preserves the SOAP headers.

The Iterate mediator is similar to the Clone mediator . The difference between the two mediators is, the Iterate mediator splits a message into different parts, whereas the Clone mediator makes multiple identical copies of the message. Info The Iterate mediator is a content aware mediator. Note Iterate Mediator is quite similar to the ForEach mediator . You can use complex XPath expressions or JSON expressions to conditionally select elements to iterate over in both mediators. Following are the main difference between ForEach and Iterate mediators: Use the ForEach mediator only for message transformations. If you need to make back-end calls from each iteration, then use the iterate mediator. ForEach supports modifying the original payload. You can use Iterate for situations where you send the split messages to a target and collect them by an Aggregate in a different flow You need to always accompany an Iterate with an Aggregate mediator. ForEach loops over the sub-messages and merges them back to the same parent element of the message. In Iterate you need to send the split messages to an endpoint to continue the message flow. However, ForEach does not allow using Call , Send and Callout mediators in the sequence. ForEach does not split the message flow, unlike Iterate Mediator. It guarantees to execute in the same thread until all iterations are complete. When you use ForEach mediator, you can only loop through segments of the message and do changes to a particular segment. For example, you can change the payload using payload factory mediator. But you cannot send the split message out to a service. Once you exit from the for-each loop, it automatically aggregates the split segments. This replaces the for-each function of the complex XSLT mediators using a ForEach mediator and a Payload Factory mediator. However, to implement the split-aggregate pattern, you still need to use Iterate mediator.

Expression : If this is selected, the property value will be determined during mediation by evaluating an expression. This expression should be entered in the Value/ Expression parameter. Value/Expression This parameter is used to enter a status value as the property value, or to enter an expression to evaluate the property value based on the what you entered for the Property Value parameter. When specifying a JSONPath, use the format json-eval(<JSON_PATH>) , such as json-eval(getQuote.request.symbol) .

Configuring a mediation sequence \u00b6 You can define mediation sequences using the Management Console as described in Adding a Mediation Sequence . The underlying Synapse configuration uses the following syntax: ``` html/xml mediator* You can list the mediators right in the sequence definition (referred to as an **in-line sequence** ) and refer to other sequences by name. For example: ``` html/xml <sequence name=\"foo\"> <log/> <property name=\"test\" value=\"test value\"/> <sequence key=\"other_sequence\"/> <send/> </sequence> This sequence specifies three mediators in-line: the log mediator , property mediator , and the send mediator . It also references the named sequence \"other_sequence\" and therefore uses all the mediators defined in that sequence. In addition to mediators and other sequences, you can configure the following: Create a dynamic sequence by referring to an entry in the registry, in which case the sequence will change as the registry entry changes. Activate statistics collection by setting the statistics attribute to enable. In this mode the sequence will keep track of the number of messages processed and their processing times. For more information, see Monitoring WSO2 EI Using WSO2 Analytics . Activate trace collection by setting the trace attribute to enable.

For more information on using JSON with the ESB profile , see Working with JSON Message Payloads . ``` html/xml { \"coordinates\": null, \"created_at\": \"Fri Jun 24 17:43:26 +0000 2011\", \"truncated\": false, \"favorited\": false, \"id_str\": \"$1\", \"entities\": { \"urls\": [ ], \"hashtags\": [ { \"text\": \"$2\", \"indices\": [ 35, 45 ] } ], \"user_mentions\": [ ] }, \"in_reply_to_user_id_str\": null, \"contributors\": null, \"text\": \"$3\", \"retweet_count\": 0, \"id\": \"##\", \"in_reply_to_status_id_str\": null, \"geo\": null, \"retweeted\": false, \"in_reply_to_user_id\": null, \"source\": \"<a href=\\\"http://sites.google.com/site/yorufukurou/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">YoruFukurou</a>\", \"in_reply_to_screen_name\": null, \"user\": { \"id_str\": \"##\", \"id\": \"##\" }, \"place\": null, \"in_reply_to_status_id\": null } </format> <args> <arg expression=\"$.entities.hashtags[0].text\" evaluator=\"json\"/> <arg expression=\"//entities/hashtags/text\"/> <arg expression=\"//user/id\"/> <arg expression=\"//user/id_str\"/> <arg expression=\"$.user.id\" evaluator=\"json\"/> <arg expression=\"$.user.id_str\" evaluator=\"json\"/> </args> </payloadFactory> <property name=\"messageType\" value=\"application/json\" scope=\"axis2\"/> ``` Note \u00b6 By default, JSON messages are converted to XML when they are received by the PayloadFactor mediator. However, if you enable the JSON stream formatter and builder, incoming JSON messages are left in JSON format, which improves performance. To enable them, uncomment the following lines in <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml : html/xml <!--messageFormatter contentType=\"application/json\" class=\"org.apache.axis2.json.JSONStreamFormatter\"/--> <!--messageBuilder contentType=\"application/json\" class=\"org.apache.axis2.json.JSONStreamBuilder\"/--> When the JSON stream formatter and builder are enabled, if you specify a JSON expression in the PayloadFactory mediator, you must use the evaluator attribute to specify that it is JSON. You can also use the evaluator to specify that an XPath expression is XML, or if you omit the evaluator attribute, XML is assumed by default.

You can prioritize messages to ensure that high-priority messages are not dropped. Prioritization is implemented at two levels in WSO2 EI: HTTP transport level - If users would like to use the EI as a pure router. Message mediation level - If users use EI for heavy processing like XSLT and XQuery. From the users perspective, key to any priority mediation is to determine the priority of an incoming message. At the message mediation layer, this can be done using content filters. This means the full power of EI configuration language is available to the user for determining the priority of a given message. For example, a message may contain an element called \"priority\" and depending on its value the priority can be determined. At the HTTP layer, user has access to HTTP headers, HTTP parameters and URL values. By looking at these values, user can determine the priority of a given message. The priority mediation implementation is based on Queues and ThreadPoolExecutors . ThreadPoolExecutor accepts a BlockingQueue implementation. A custom blocking queue that can be used to order the jobs based on priority was implemented. ThreadPoolExecutor starts queuing only when the all the core threads are busy. Every message should get equal priority until all the core threads are used. Internally custom BlockingQueue uses multiple queues for accepting jobs with different priorities. Once jobs are put into the queue, it uses a pluggable algorithm for choosing the next job. The default algorithm chooses the jobs based on a priority-based, round-robin algorithm. For example, let's say we have two priorities, 10 and 1. This algorithm tries to fetch 10 items with priority 10 and then 1 item with the priority 1. Priority Executors \u00b6 Priority executors can be used with the Enqueue Mediator to execute sequences with a given priority. Priority executors are used in high-load scenarios when you wants to execute different sequences for messages with different priorities. This approach allows you to control the resources allocated to executing sequences and to prevent high-priority messages from getting delayed and dropped.

HTTP Transport Properties : Allow you to configure how the HTTP transport processes messages, such as forcing a 202 HTTP response to the client so that it stops waiting for a response, setting the HTTP status code, and appending a context to the target URL in RESTful invocations. SOAP Headers : Provide information about the message, such as the To and From values. Axis2 Properties : Allow you to configure the web services engine in the ESB profile, such as specifying how to cache JMS objects, setting the minimum and maximum threads for consuming messages, and forcing outgoing HTTP/S messages to use HTTP 1.0. Synapse Message Context Properties : Allow you to get information about the message, such as the date/time it was sent, the message format, and the message operation. For many properties, you can use the Property mediator to retrieve and set the properties.

Set Action As The possible values for this parameter are as follows: Value : If this is selected, a static value would be considered as the property value and this value should be entered in the Value parameter. Expression : If this is selected, the property value will be determined during mediation by evaluating an expression. This expression should be entered in the Expression parameter. Type The data type for the property. Property mediator will handle the property as a property of selected type. Available values are as follows. STRING INTEGER BOOLEAN DOUBLE FLOAT LONG SHORT OM String is the default type. !!! info The OM type is used to set xml property values on the message context. This is useful when the expression associated with the property mediator evaluates to an XML node during mediation. When the OM type is used, the XML is converted to an AXIOM OMElement before it is assigned to a property. Value If the Value option is selected for the Set Action As parameter, the property value should be entered as a constant in this parameter. Expression If the Expression option is selected for the Set Action As parameter, the expression which determines the property value should be entered in this parameter. This expression can be an XPath expression or a JSONPath expression. When specifying a JSONPath, use the format json-eval(<JSON_PATH>) , such as json-eval(getQuote.request.symbol) . In both XPath and JSONPath expressions, you can return the value of another property by calling get-property(property-name) . For example, you might create a property called JSON_PATH of which the value is json-eval(pizza.toppings) , and then you could create another property called JSON_PRINT of which the value is get-property('JSON_PATH') , allowing you to use the value of the JSON_PATH property in the JSON_PRINT property.

Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Pattern This parameter is used to enter a regular expression that will be evaluated against the value of the property or result of the XPath/JSON Path expression. Group The number (index) of the matching item evaluated using the regular expression entered in the Pattern parameter. Scope The scope at which the property will be set or removed from. Possible values are as follows. Synapse : This is the default scope. The properties set in this scope last as long as the transaction (request-response) exists. Transport : The properties set in this scope will be considered transport headers. For example, if it is required to send an HTTP header named 'CustomHeader' with an outgoing request, you can use the property mediator configuration with this scope. Axis2 : Properties set in this scope have a shorter life span than those set in the Synapse scope. They are mainly used for passing parameters to the underlying Axis2 engine axis2-client : This is similar to the Synapse scope. The difference between the two scopes is that the axis2-client scope can be accessed inside the mediate() method of a mediator via a custom mediator created using the Class mediator .

You can perform all Script Mediator functionalities that the Rhino engine provides, with the Nashorn engine as well. Info You need to install JDK 8 version update 112 or later to use Nashorn support, If not, you get the following exception when you call the setPayloadJSON() method: java.lang.ClassCastException: jdk.nashorn.internal.runtime.Undefined cannot be cast to java.lang.String For more information, see the bug that causes this , which is fixed in JDK 8 version update 112 or later. The Rhino engine uses E4X XML objects to handle XML payloads. However, E4X is deprecated in the Nashorn engine. Instead, Nashorn supports the AXIOM XML parser to parse XML streams. You can use the getParsedOMElement(InputStream stream) method to parse an XML stream into an OMElement, and the getXpathResult(String expression) method to retrieve the AXIOMXPath using an Xpath query expression to access and modify it. The XPath equivalents for a few common XML navigation operations are as follows. Operation XPath expression E4X equivalent Select all the children of an element element/* element.* Select all the attributes of element element/@* element.@* Select all the descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of an element element//descendent element..descendent Select the parent of an element .. or parent::element element.parent() Select a specific child (e.g. foo:bar ) of an element, where 'foo' is the prefix of a declared namespace xmlns:foo=\"...\" element/foo:bar var foo = new Namespace(...); element.foo::bar Return the full name (including prefixes if available) of an element name(element) element.name() Return the local name of an element local-name(element) element.localName() Return the namespace URI of an element (if available) namespace-uri(element) element.namespace() Return the collection of namespaces. For E4X: returns as an Array of Namespace objects For XPath: returns as a set of Namespaces nodes element/namespace::* element.inScopeNamespaces() Return the processing instructions of the specified children of an element (returns all if omitted) element/processing-instructions(name) element.processingInstructions(name) Return the concatenated text nodes and descendants of an element string(element) stringValue(element); You can create a Script mediator with Nashorn support using one of the following methods. Store the JavaScript program statements in a separate file, and refer it via a Local or Remote Registry entry . Embed the JavaScript program statements inline within the Synapse configuration. You can invoke a function within the corresponding script using the Script Mediator. Hence, you can predefine the Synapse configuration in a script variable named mc , and access it via these functions. The mc variable represents an implementation of the NashornScriptMessageContext.java MessageContext. It is an implementation of the ScriptMessageContext interface, which contains the following methods. You can access these methods within the script (e.g., mc.methodName ). Method name Description If a value is returned or not getParsedOMElement(stream) Converts the input stream of an XML String or document into an OMElement. This is useful to traverse the XML document. Yes getXpathResult(expression) Converts a String, which represents an Xpath expression into an AXIOM Xpath. This is useful to traverse the XML document. Yes addHeader(mustUnderstand, content) Adds a new SOAP header to the message. Content can be XML, String, parsed w3c.dom.Document, or an OMElement returned by the getParsedOMElement(stream) method. No getEnvelopeXML() Retrieves the XML representation of the complete SOAP envelope. Yes getPayloadJSON() Retrieves the JSON representation of a SOAP Body payload. Yes getPayloadXML() Retrieves the XML representation of a SOAP Body payload. This method Returns a OMElement so the user can directly access elements using Xpath. Yes getProperty(name) Retrieves a specified property from the current message context. Yes setPayloadJSON(payload) Sets the JSON representation of a payload obtained via the getPayloadJSON() method in the current message context. No setPayloadXML(payload) Sets the SOAP body payload from the XML. Payload can be XML, String, parsed w3c.dom.Document or an OMElement returned by the getParsedOMElement(stream) method. No setProperty(key, value) Replaces the existing property values a property in the current message context. No The Script Mediator has the flexibility of a class Mediator, with access to the Synapse Message Context and Synapse Environment APIs. For both types of script mediator definitions, the Message Context passed into the script has additional methods over the standard Synapse Message Context, to enable working with natural XML to JavaScript. Info The Script mediator is a content aware mediator. Syntax | Configuration | Examples Syntax \u00b6 Click on the relevant tab to view the syntax for a script mediator using an Inline script, or a script mediator using a script of the Registry. Using an Inline script Using a script in the Registry The following syntax applies when you create a Script mediator with the script program statements embedded inline within the Synapse configuration. <script language=\"nashornJs\"><![CDATA[......Nashorn JavaScript source code\u2026\u2026.. ]]></script> The following syntax applies when you create a Script mediator with the script program statements stored in a separate file, referenced via the Local or Remote Registry entry . This uses a key to refer to a script, which is already saved in the Registry. <script key=\"string\" language=\"nashornJs\" [function=\"script-function-name\"]> <include key=\"string\"/> </script> Configuration \u00b6 Click on the relevant tab to view the required UI configuration depending on the script type you have selected. The available script types are as follows: Inline : If this script type is selected, the script is specified inline. Registry Key : If this script type is selected, a script which is already saved in the registry will be referred using a key. Inline Using a script in the Registry The parameters available to configure a Script mediator using an inline script are as follows. Parameter Name Description Language The scripting language for the Script mediator. You can select from the following available languages. JavaScript - This is represented as js in the source view. Groovy - This is represented as groovy in the source view. Ruby - This is represented as rb in the source view. Source Enter the source in this parameter. The parameters available to configure a Script mediator using a script saved in the registry are as follows. Parameter Name Description Language The scripting language for the Script mediator. You can select from the following available languages. JavaScript - This is represented as js in the source view. Groovy - This is represented as groovy in the source view. Ruby - This is represented as rb in the source view. Function The function of the selected script language to be invoked. This is an optional parameter. If no value is specified, a default function named mediate will be applied. This function considers the Synapse MessageContext as a single parameter. The function may return a boolean. If it does not, then the value true is assumed and the Script mediator returns this value. Key Type You can select one of the following options. Static Key : If this is selected, an existing key can be selected from the registry for the Key parameter. Dynamic Key : If this is selected, the key can be entered dynamically in the Key parameter. Key The Registry location of the source. You can click either Configuration Registry or the Governance Registry to select the source from the resource tree. Include keys This parameter allows you to include functions defined in two or more scripts your Script mediator configuration. After pointing to one script in the Key parameter, you can click Add Include Key to add the function in another script. When you click Add Include Key , the following parameters will be displayed. Enter the script to be included in the Key parameter by clicking either Configuration Registry or the Governance Registry and then selecting the relevant script from the resource tree. Examples \u00b6 Example 1 - Using an inline script Example 2 - Using a script saved in the registry Examples for methods Assume the below SOAP envelope for the following examples: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"> <soapenv:Header> <AuthenticationInfo xmlns=\"http://www.x\" soapenv:mustUnderstand=\"0\"> <userName>\u201dwso2\u201d</userName> <password>\u201dwso2\u201d</password> </AuthenticationInfo> </soapenv:Header> <soapenv:Body> <company> <staff id=\"1001\"> <firstname>\u201dyong\u201d</firstname> <lastname>\u201dmook kim\u201d</lastname> <nickname>\u201dmkyong\u201d</nickname> <salary>100000</salary> </staff> <staff id=\"2001\"> <firstname> \u201clow\u201d</firstname> <lastname>\u201dyin fong\u201d</lastname> <nickname>\u201dfong fong\u201d</nickname> <salary>200000</salary> </staff> </company> </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> Example 1 - Using an inline script \u00b6 The following configuration is an example of using a Nashorn JavaScript script inline in the Script Mediator. In this script, you get the message payload in XML and you use an Xpath query to access the elements of it. <script language=\"nashornJs\"><![CDATA[var symbol = mc.getPayloadXML(); var expression = \"//firstname\"; var xpath = mc.getXpathResult(expression); var c1l = xpath.selectNodes(symbol); var first_name = c1l.get(0).getText(); ]]></script> Example 2 - Using a script saved in the registry \u00b6 In the following example, the script is loaded from the Registry using the key repository/conf/sample/resources/script/test.js . <script language=\"nashornJs\" key=\"repository/conf/sample/resources/script/test.js\" function=\"testFunction\"/> The script language=\"nashornJs\" property indicates that the invoked function should be in the Nashorn JavaScript language.

You can perform all Script Mediator functionalities that the Rhino engine provides, with the Nashorn engine as well. Info You need to install JDK 8 version update 112 or later to use Nashorn support, If not, you get the following exception when you call the setPayloadJSON() method: java.lang.ClassCastException: jdk.nashorn.internal.runtime.Undefined cannot be cast to java.lang.String For more information, see the bug that causes this , which is fixed in JDK 8 version update 112 or later. The Rhino engine uses E4X XML objects to handle XML payloads. However, E4X is deprecated in the Nashorn engine. Instead, Nashorn supports the AXIOM XML parser to parse XML streams. You can use the getParsedOMElement(InputStream stream) method to parse an XML stream into an OMElement, and the getXpathResult(String expression) method to retrieve the AXIOMXPath using an Xpath query expression to access and modify it. The XPath equivalents for a few common XML navigation operations are as follows. Operation XPath expression E4X equivalent Select all the children of an element element/* element.* Select all the attributes of element element/@* element.@* Select all the descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of an element element//descendent element..descendent Select the parent of an element .. or parent::element element.parent() Select a specific child (e.g. foo:bar ) of an element, where 'foo' is the prefix of a declared namespace xmlns:foo=\"...\" element/foo:bar var foo = new Namespace(...); element.foo::bar Return the full name (including prefixes if available) of an element name(element) element.name() Return the local name of an element local-name(element) element.localName() Return the namespace URI of an element (if available) namespace-uri(element) element.namespace() Return the collection of namespaces.

Store the JavaScript program statements in a separate file, and refer it via a Local or Remote Registry entry . Embed the JavaScript program statements inline within the Synapse configuration. You can invoke a function within the corresponding script using the Script Mediator. Hence, you can predefine the Synapse configuration in a script variable named mc , and access it via these functions. The mc variable represents an implementation of the NashornScriptMessageContext.java MessageContext. It is an implementation of the ScriptMessageContext interface, which contains the following methods. You can access these methods within the script (e.g., mc.methodName ). Method name Description If a value is returned or not getParsedOMElement(stream) Converts the input stream of an XML String or document into an OMElement. This is useful to traverse the XML document. Yes getXpathResult(expression) Converts a String, which represents an Xpath expression into an AXIOM Xpath. This is useful to traverse the XML document. Yes addHeader(mustUnderstand, content) Adds a new SOAP header to the message. Content can be XML, String, parsed w3c.dom.Document, or an OMElement returned by the getParsedOMElement(stream) method. No getEnvelopeXML() Retrieves the XML representation of the complete SOAP envelope. Yes getPayloadJSON() Retrieves the JSON representation of a SOAP Body payload. Yes getPayloadXML() Retrieves the XML representation of a SOAP Body payload. This method Returns a OMElement so the user can directly access elements using Xpath. Yes getProperty(name) Retrieves a specified property from the current message context. Yes setPayloadJSON(payload) Sets the JSON representation of a payload obtained via the getPayloadJSON() method in the current message context. No setPayloadXML(payload) Sets the SOAP body payload from the XML. Payload can be XML, String, parsed w3c.dom.Document or an OMElement returned by the getParsedOMElement(stream) method. No setProperty(key, value) Replaces the existing property values a property in the current message context. No The Script Mediator has the flexibility of a class Mediator, with access to the Synapse Message Context and Synapse Environment APIs. For both types of script mediator definitions, the Message Context passed into the script has additional methods over the standard Synapse Message Context, to enable working with natural XML to JavaScript.

Note The ESB profile of WSO2 EI uses Rhino engine to execute JavaScripts. Rhino engine converts the script to a method inside a Java class. Therefore, when processing large JSON data volumes, the code length must be less than 65536 characters, since the Script mediator converts the payload into a Java object. However, you can use the following alternative options to process large JSON data volumes. Achieve the same functionality via a Class mediator . If the original message consists of repetitive sections, you can use the Iterate mediator to generate a relatively small payload using those repetitive sections. This will then allow you to use the Script mediator. From WSO2 EI 6.2.0 onwards, the Script Mediator supports using Nashorn to execute JavaScripts, in addition to its default Rhino engine. For more information, see Script Mediator with Nashorn Support . A Script mediator can be created in one of the following methods. With the script program statements stored in a separate file, referenced via the Local or Remote Registry entry . With the script program statements embedded inline within the Synapse configuration. Synapse uses the Apache Bean Scripting Framework for scripting language support. Any script language supported by BSF may be used to implement the Synapse Mediator. With the Script Mediator, you can invoke a function in the corresponding script. With these functions, it is possible to access the Synapse predefined in a script variable named mc . The mc variable represents an implementation of the MessageContext , named ScriptMessageContext.java , which contains the following methods that can be accessed within the script as mc.methodName . Return? Method Name Description Yes getPayloadXML() This gets an XML representation of SOAP Body payload. No setPayloadXML(payload) This sets the SOAP body payload from XML. No addHeader(mustUnderstand, content) This adds a new SOAP header to the message. Yes getEnvelopeXML() This gets the XML representation of the complete SOAP envelope. No setTo(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the receiver of the message. Yes setFaultTo(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the receiver of the faults relating to the message. No setFrom(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the sender of the message. No setReplyTo(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the receiver of the replies to the message. Yes getPayloadJSON() This gets the JSON representation of a SOAP Body payload. No setPayloadJSON( payload ) This sets the JSON representation of a payload obtained via the getPayloadJSON() method and sets it in the current message context. Yes getProperty(name) This gets a property from the current message context. No setProperty(key, value) This is used to set a property in the current message context. The previously set property values are replaced by this method. Implementing a Mediator with a script language has advantages over using the built-in Synapse Mediator types or implementing a custom Java class Mediator. The Script Mediators have the flexibility of a class Mediator with access to the Synapse MessageContext and SynapseEnvironment APIs. Also, the ease of use and dynamic nature of scripting languages allow the rapid development and prototyping of custom mediators. An additional benefit of some scripting languages is that they have very simple and elegant XML manipulation capabilities, which make them very usable in a Synapse mediation environment. e.g., JavaScript E4X or Ruby REXML. For both types of script mediator definitions, the MessageContext passed into the script has additional methods over the standard Synapse MessageContext to enable working with XML natural to the scripting language. Example are when using JavaScript getPayloadXML and setPayloadXML , E4X XML objects and when using Ruby, REXML documents. Info The Script mediator is a content-aware mediator. Prerequisites | Syntax | Configuration | Examples Prerequisites \u00b6 Listed below are the prerequisites for writing a Script mediator using JavaScript, Groovy, or Ruby. Scripting Language Prerequisite Groovy Download the groovy-all -2.4.4.jar file and copy it to the <EI_HOME>/ dropins directory.

The function named testFunction which is invoked should be saved as a resource in the Registry . The script can be as shown in the example below. function testFunction(mc) { var symbol = mc.getPayloadXML()..*::Code.toString(); mc.setPayloadXML( <m:getQuote xmlns:m=\"http://services.samples/xsd\"> <m:request> <m:symbol>{symbol}</m:symbol> </m:request> </m:getQuote>); } Example 3 - Adding an Include key \u00b6 The following configuration has an include key . <script language=\"js\" key=\"stockquoteScript\" function=\"transformRequest\"> <include key=\"sampleScript\"/> </script> The script is written in JavaScript. The function to be executed is transformRequest . This function may be as follows in a script saved in the Registry . // stockquoteTransform.js function transformRequest(mc) { transformRequestFunction(mc); } function transformResponse(mc) { transformResponseFunction(mc); } In addition, the function in the script named sampleScript which is included in the mediation configuration via the include key sub element is also executed in the mediation. Note that in order to do this, sampleScript script should also be saved as a resource in the Registry . This script can be as follows. // sample.js function transformRequestFunction(mc) { var symbol = mc.getPayloadXML()..*::Code.toString(); mc.setPayloadXML( <m:getquote m=\"http://services.samples\"> <m:request> <m:symbol>{symbol}</m:symbol> </m:request> </m:getquote>); } function transformResponse(mc) { var symbol = mc.getPayloadXML()..*::symbol.toString(); var price = mc.getPayloadXML()..*::last.toString(); mc.setPayloadXML( <m:checkpriceresponse m=\"http://services.samples/xsd\"> <m:code>{symbol}</m:code> <m:price>{price}</m:price> </m:checkpriceresponse>); } Example 4 - Adding a custom SOAP header \u00b6 You can add custom SOAP headers to a request by using the addHeader(mustUnderstand, content) of the Script Mediator in a proxy service as shown in the example below. <proxy xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\" name=\"CustomSOAPHeaderProxy\" startOnLoad=\"true\" statistics=\"disable\" trace=\"disable\" transports=\"http,https\"> <target> <inSequence> <log level=\"full\"> <property name=\"Message\" value=\"IncomingRequest\"/> </log> <script language=\"js\">mc.addHeader(false, &lt;ns:sampleCustomHeader xmlns:ns=\"gsb:http://wso2.org/sample\"&gt;&lt;ns:customInfo&gt;CustomHeader&lt;/ns:customInfo&gt;&lt;/ns:sampleCustomHeader&gt;);</script> <log level=\"full\"> <property name=\"Message\" value=\"UpdatedMessage\"/> </log> <drop/> </inSequence> </target> <description/> </proxy> Example per method \u00b6 The following table contains examples of how some of the commonly used methods can be included in the script invoked by the following sample Script mediator configuration. <script language=\"js\" key=\"conf:/repository/EI/transform.js\" function=\"transform\"/> Return?

Note The ESB profile of WSO2 EI uses Rhino engine to execute JavaScripts. Rhino engine converts the script to a method inside a Java class. Therefore, when processing large JSON data volumes, the code length must be less than 65536 characters, since the Script mediator converts the payload into a Java object. However, you can use the following alternative options to process large JSON data volumes. Achieve the same functionality via a Class mediator . If the original message consists of repetitive sections, you can use the Iterate mediator to generate a relatively small payload using those repetitive sections. This will then allow you to use the Script mediator. From WSO2 EI 6.2.0 onwards, the Script Mediator supports using Nashorn to execute JavaScripts, in addition to its default Rhino engine. For more information, see Script Mediator with Nashorn Support . A Script mediator can be created in one of the following methods. With the script program statements stored in a separate file, referenced via the Local or Remote Registry entry . With the script program statements embedded inline within the Synapse configuration. Synapse uses the Apache Bean Scripting Framework for scripting language support. Any script language supported by BSF may be used to implement the Synapse Mediator. With the Script Mediator, you can invoke a function in the corresponding script. With these functions, it is possible to access the Synapse predefined in a script variable named mc . The mc variable represents an implementation of the MessageContext , named ScriptMessageContext.java , which contains the following methods that can be accessed within the script as mc.methodName . Return? Method Name Description Yes getPayloadXML() This gets an XML representation of SOAP Body payload. No setPayloadXML(payload) This sets the SOAP body payload from XML. No addHeader(mustUnderstand, content) This adds a new SOAP header to the message. Yes getEnvelopeXML() This gets the XML representation of the complete SOAP envelope. No setTo(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the receiver of the message. Yes setFaultTo(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the receiver of the faults relating to the message. No setFrom(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the sender of the message. No setReplyTo(reference) This is used to set the value which specifies the receiver of the replies to the message. Yes getPayloadJSON() This gets the JSON representation of a SOAP Body payload. No setPayloadJSON( payload ) This sets the JSON representation of a payload obtained via the getPayloadJSON() method and sets it in the current message context. Yes getProperty(name) This gets a property from the current message context. No setProperty(key, value) This is used to set a property in the current message context. The previously set property values are replaced by this method. Implementing a Mediator with a script language has advantages over using the built-in Synapse Mediator types or implementing a custom Java class Mediator. The Script Mediators have the flexibility of a class Mediator with access to the Synapse MessageContext and SynapseEnvironment APIs. Also, the ease of use and dynamic nature of scripting languages allow the rapid development and prototyping of custom mediators. An additional benefit of some scripting languages is that they have very simple and elegant XML manipulation capabilities, which make them very usable in a Synapse mediation environment. e.g., JavaScript E4X or Ruby REXML. For both types of script mediator definitions, the MessageContext passed into the script has additional methods over the standard Synapse MessageContext to enable working with XML natural to the scripting language. Example are when using JavaScript getPayloadXML and setPayloadXML , E4X XML objects and when using Ruby, REXML documents. Info The Script mediator is a content-aware mediator.

Messages may be correlated by WS-A MessageID, or even simple custom text labels. Info A send operation can be blocking or non-blocking depending on the actual transport implementation used. The default NIO-based http/s implementation does not block on a send. Therefore, if a message should be sent and further processed (e.g. transformed) afterwards, it is required to clone the message into two copies and then perform the processing to avoid conflicts.

Build Message Before Sending This parameter is used to specify whether the message should be built before sending or not. The possible values are as follows. Yes : If this is selected, the full message XML is built in the memory before the message is sent. Yes should be selected if your configuration includes a logic that is performed after the Send has initiated. No : If this is selected, the full message XML is not built in the memory before the message is sent. This improves performance. Examples \u00b6 Example 1 - Send mediator used in the In sequence and Out sequence \u00b6 In this example, the first send operation is included in the In mediator. Both the request and response will go through the main sequence, but only request messages will go through the In mediator. Similarly, only response messages will go through the Out mediator. The request will be forwarded to the endpoint with the given address. The response will go through the second send operation, which in this example just sends it back to the client because there is no Out endpoint specified. <definitions xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\"> <in> <send> <endpoint> <address uri=\"http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService\"/> </endpoint> </send> <drop/> </in> <out> <send/> </out> </definitions> Example 2 - Specifying a response handling sequence (service chaining) \u00b6 ``` html/xml In this example, requests are sent to the ` PersonInfoEpr ` endpoint, and responses from the service at that endpoint are handled by a sequence named personInfoSeq. This approach is particularly useful for service chaining. For example, if you want to take the responses from the ` PersonInfoEpr ` service and send them to the ` CreditEpr ` service for additional processing before sending the final response back to the client. In this case, you can configure the ` personInfoSeq ` sequence to send the response to the ` CreditEpr ` service and also specify another receive sequence named ` creditSeq ` that sends the response from the ` CreditEpr ` service back to the client. Following is the configuration of these sequences. ``` html/xml <sequence name=\"personInfoSeq\"> <xslt key=\"xslt\"> <property name=\"amount\" expression=\"get-property('ORG_AMOUNT')\"/> </xslt> <send receive=\"creditSeq\"> <endpoint key=\"CreditEpr\"/> </send> </sequence> <sequence name=\"creditSeq\"> <log level=\"full\"/> <send/> </sequence> Example 3 - Configuring a blocking/non-blocking send operation \u00b6 In this example, the Send mediator in a proxy service using the VFS transport is transferring a file to a VFS endpoint. VFS is a non-blocking transport by default, which means a new thread is spawned for each outgoing message. The Property mediator added before the Send mediator removes the ClientAPINonBlocking property from the message to perform the mediation in a single thread. This is required when the file being transferred is large and you want to avoid out-of-memory failures. <inSequence> <property name=\"ClientApiNonBlocking\" value=\"true\" scope=\"axis2\" action=\"remove\"/> <send> <endpoint name=\"FileEpr\"> <address uri=\"vfs:file:////home/shammi/file-out\"/> </endpoint> </send> </inSequence>","title":"Send Mediator"},{"location":"references/send-Mediator/#send-mediator","text":"The Send Mediator is used to send messages out of Synapse to an endpoint.

In this case, you can configure the ` personInfoSeq ` sequence to send the response to the ` CreditEpr ` service and also specify another receive sequence named ` creditSeq ` that sends the response from the ` CreditEpr ` service back to the client.

This is useful when services used at the enterprise level and it is required to avoid heavy loads that can cause performance issues in the system. It can also be used when you want to avoid certain user groups (i.e. IP addresses and domains) accessing your system. The Throttle mediator defines a throttle group which includes the following. A throttle policy which defines the extent to which, individuals and groups of IP addresses/domains should be allowed to access the service. A mediation sequence to handle requests that were accepted based on the throttle policy. A mediation sequence to handle requests that were rejected based on the throttle policy.

Before you edit these sections, enter an ID for the Throttle group in the Throttle Group ID parameter. Throttle Policy On Acceptance On Rejection Throttle Policy \u00b6 This section is used to specify the throttle policy that should apply to the requests passing through the Throttle mediator. A throttle policy has a number of entries defining the extent to which, an individual or a group of IP addresses/domains should be allowed to access the service. The parameters available to be configured in this section are as follows. Parameter Name Description Throttle Policy This section is used to specify the policy for throttling. The following options are available. In-Lined Policy : If this is selected, the Throttle policy can be defined within the Throttle mediator configuration. Click Throttle Policy Editor to open the Mediator Throttling Configuration dialog box where the details relating to the Throttle policy can be entered. The parameters in this dialog box are described in the table below. Referring Policy : If this is selected, you can refer to a pre-defined Throttle policy which is saved in the Registry. You can enter the key to access the policy in the Referring Policy parameter. Click on either Configuration Registry or Governance Registry to select the relevant policy from the Resource Tree. The parameters available in the Mediator Throttling Configuration dialog box to configure the Throttling policy are as follows. Parameter Name Description Maximum Concurrent Accesses The maximum number of messages that are served at a given time. The number of messages between the inflow throttle handler and the outflow throttle handler cannot exceed the value entered for this parameter at any given time. This parameter value is applied to the entire system. It is not restricted to one or more specific IP addresses/domains. !!! info When this parameter is used, the same Throttle mediator ID should be included in the response flow so that the completed responses are deducted from the available limit. Range This parameter is used to specify the IP addresses/domains to which the entry in the current row should be applied If you want to apply the entry to a range of IP addresses, enter the range in this parameter, e.g., 8.100.1.30 \u2013 8.100.1.45 . Alternatively, you can enter a single IP address to apply the entry to only one IP address. If you want to apply the entry to a domain, enter the required domain ID in this parameter. If you want to apply the entry to all the IP addresses/domains that are not configured in the other configurations, enter other in this parameter. Type This parameter is used to specify whether the value(s) entered in the Range parameter refers to IP addresses or domains. Max Request Count This parameter specifies the maximum number of requests that should be handled within the time interval specified in the Unit Time parameter. !!! tip This parameter is applicable only when the value selected for the Access parameter is Control . Unit Time (ms) The time interval for which the maximum number of requests specified for the Throttle ID in the Max Request Count parameter apply. !!! tip This parameter is applicable only when the value selected for the Access parameter is Control . Prohibit Time Period (ms) If the number of requests entered in the Max Request Count parameter is achieved before the time interval entered in the Unit Time (ms) parameter has elapsed, no more requests are taken by the inflow throttle handler for the time period entered in this parameter. Entering a value in this parameter alters the unit time. For example: Max Request Count = 50 Unit Time = 50000 ms Prohibit Time Period = 5000 ms If 50 requests are received within 50000 milliseconds , no requests will be taken for the next 5000 milliseconds. Thus, the time slot considered as the unit time is changed to 40000 milliseconds. If no value is entered in the Prohibit Time Period (ms) parameter, no requests will be taken until 15000 more milliseconds (i.e. the remainder of the unit time) have elapsed. !!! tip This parameter is applicable only when the value selected for the Access parameter is Control . Access This parameter is used to specify the extent to which the IP addresses/domains specified in the Range parameter are allowed access to the service to which the throttle policy is applied. Possible values are as follows. Allow : If this is selected, the specified IP addresses/domains are allowed to access the services to which the throttle ID is applied without any restrictions. Deny : If this is selected, specified IP addresses/domains are not allowed to access the services to which the throttle ID is applied . Control : If this is selected, the specified IP addresses/domains a re allowed to access the services to which the throttle ID is applied. However, the number of times they can access the services is controlled by the Max Request Count , Unit Time (ms) and the Prohibit Time Period (ms) parameters. Action This parameter can be used to delete the entry. On Acceptance \u00b6 This section is used to specify the mediation sequence that should be applied when a request is accepted based on the throttle policy defined for the Throttle mediator. The parameters available to be configured in this section are as follows. Parameter Name Description Specify As This parameter is used to specify how the On Acceptance sequence is defined. The following options are available. In-Lined Policy : If this is selected, the mediation sequence to be applied to accepted requests can be defined within the Throttle mediator configuration. Click on the OnAccept node in the mediation tree to define the sequence in-line. Referring Policy : If this is selected, you can refer to a pre-defined mediation sequence in the registry. Click either Configuration Registry or Governance Registry as relevant to select the required sequence from the Resource Tree. On Rejection \u00b6 This section is used to specify the mediation sequence that should be applied when a request is rejected based on the throttle policy defined for the Throttle mediator. The parameters available to be configured in this section are as follows. Parameter Name Description Specify As This parameter is used to specify how the On Acceptance sequence is defined. The following options are available. In-Lined Policy : If this is selected, the mediation sequence to be applied to rejected requests can be defined within the Throttle mediator configuration. Click on the OnReject node in the mediation tree to define the sequence in-line. Referring Policy : If this is selected, you can refer to a pre-defined mediation sequence in the registry. Click either Configuration Registry or Governance Registry as relevant to select the required sequence from the Resource Tree. Examples \u00b6 In this example, the Throttle Mediator inside the In Mediator . Therefore, all request messages directed to the main sequence will be subjected to throttling. The Throttle Mediator has policy , onAccept and onReject tags at top level. The policy tag specifies the throttling policy for throttling messages. The onAccept sequence includes a Log mediator with a custom log to log the accepted requests.Then the Send mediator sends these requests to http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService . The OnReject sequence too includes a Log mediator with a custom log to log the rejected requests. Then a Fault mediator is used to convert the message into a fault message. The fault message is then returned to the client as a response using the Respond mediator , and then dropped using the Drop mediator .

Prohibit Time Period (ms) If the number of requests entered in the Max Request Count parameter is achieved before the time interval entered in the Unit Time (ms) parameter has elapsed, no more requests are taken by the inflow throttle handler for the time period entered in this parameter. Entering a value in this parameter alters the unit time. For example: Max Request Count = 50 Unit Time = 50000 ms Prohibit Time Period = 5000 ms If 50 requests are received within 50000 milliseconds , no requests will be taken for the next 5000 milliseconds. Thus, the time slot considered as the unit time is changed to 40000 milliseconds. If no value is entered in the Prohibit Time Period (ms) parameter, no requests will be taken until 15000 more milliseconds (i.e. the remainder of the unit time) have elapsed. !!! tip This parameter is applicable only when the value selected for the Access parameter is Control . Access This parameter is used to specify the extent to which the IP addresses/domains specified in the Range parameter are allowed access to the service to which the throttle policy is applied. Possible values are as follows. Allow : If this is selected, the specified IP addresses/domains are allowed to access the services to which the throttle ID is applied without any restrictions. Deny : If this is selected, specified IP addresses/domains are not allowed to access the services to which the throttle ID is applied . Control : If this is selected, the specified IP addresses/domains a re allowed to access the services to which the throttle ID is applied. However, the number of times they can access the services is controlled by the Max Request Count , Unit Time (ms) and the Prohibit Time Period (ms) parameters.

When it comes to distributed transactions, it involves accessing and updating data on two or more networked computers, often using multiple databases. For example, two databases or a database and a message queue such as JMS. You can use the Synapse configuration language to define when to start, commit, or roll back the transaction. For example, you can mark the start of a transaction at the start of a database commit, mark the end of the transaction at the end of database commit and roll back the transaction if an error occurs. Let's explore a basic transaction mediator scenario that demonstrates how the transaction mediator can be used to manage complex distributed transactions. Transaction mediator scenario | Prerequisites | Configuring the example scenario | Testing the example scenario Transaction mediator scenario \u00b6 You have a record in one database and you want to delete that record from the first database and add it to a second database.

Therefore, in the successful scenario, the record will be deleted from the first database and will be added to the second database.

Info The URLRewrite mediator is a content aware mediator. Syntax | Configuration | Example Syntax \u00b6 <rewrite [inProperty=\"string\"] [outProperty=\"string\"]> <rewriterule> <condition> ... </condition>? <action [type=\"append|prepend|replace|remove|set\"] [value=\"string\"] [xpath=\"xpath\"] [fragment=\"protocol|host|port|path|query|ref|user|full\"] [regex=\"regex\"]>+ </rewriterule>+ </rewrite> Configuration \u00b6 The parameters available to configure the URL Rewrite mediator are as follows. Parameter Name Description In Property This parameter is used to enter property of which the value should be considered the input URL. The rewrite rules are applied to the value of the property entered in this parameter to generate the result URL. If no property is entered, the rewrite rules will be applied to the To header of the message. Out Property This parameter is used to enter the property to which the transformations done via the rewrite rules should be applied. If no property is entered, the transformations will be applied to the To header of the message. The Rewrite mediator applies the URL transformations by evaluating a set of rules on the message. To add a rule to the mediator, click Add Rule . The rewrite rule will be added to the mediator tree as a child of the URLRewrite mediator. Click URLRewriteRule in the mediator to configure the rewrite rule you added. A rule can consist of one or more rewrite actions and an optional condition. The Condition parameter is used to enter the optional condition. If a condition is specified, it will be evaluated before the rewrite actions, and the rewrite actions will be executed only if the condition evaluates to true . A rewrite action is added by clicking Add Action which would display a row. The parameters available to configure a rewrite action are as follows. Parameter Name Description Action This parameter is used to specify the action to be performed by the rewrite action. Each rewrite action is performed on a fragment entered in the Fragment parameter. Possible values are as follows. Replace : If this is selected, the existing in property value fragment will be replaced by the result value. Remove : If this is selected, the result value will be removed from the in property value fragment. Append : If this is selected, the result value will be added to the end of the in property value fragment. Prepend : If this is selected, the result value will be added to the beginning of the in property value fragment. Set : If this is selected, the result value will be set as the in property value fragment. Fragment The fragment of the in property (i.e. input URL) for which the rewrite action should be performed. The available fragments are as follows. Protocol : Host Port Path Query Ref User Full !!! info Note that this breakdown is inline with the URI specification (RFC2396). URL rewrite mediator enables rewriting each of the above segments separately and finally combining them to get the final URL value. It also supports rewriting the entire URL string at once. Option This parameter is used to define the result value of the rewrite action. Select one of the following. Value : If this is selected, the result value would be a static value. Expression : If this is selected, the result value will be evaluated using an expression. Value/Expression This parameter is used to enter the result value of the URLRewrite mediator as a static value or an expression, depending on what you selected for the Option parameter. Namespace Editor You can click this link to add namespaces when you are providing an expression. Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Regex This parameter is used to specify which part of the in property value fragment should be replaced by the result value if you selected Replace for the Action parameter. Delete Click Delete in the relevant row to remove a rewrite action. Example \u00b6 In this example, the URLRewrite mediator has a rewrite action which replaces the value soap with value services in the fragment path of the input URL. Since no in property or an out property is specified, the To header of the request is both the input to which the rewrite rule is applied and the target where the result URL is set. This configuration is typically used when the address URL of a request contains the context soap which needs to be converted since all the services are deployed under a context named services in the EI server. Thus, the URL http://localhost:8280/soap/StockQuoteProxy1 is rewritten as http://localhost:8280/ services /StockQuoteProxy1 to ensure that the requests are successfully delivered to the server. <rewrite> <rewriterule> <action type=\"replace\" regex=\"soap\" value=\"services\" fragment=\"path\" /> </rewriterule> </rewrite> Samples \u00b6 For more examples, see: Sample 450: Introduction to the URLRewrite Mediator Sample 451: Conditional URL Rewriting Sample 452; Conditional URL Rewriting with Multiple Rules","title":"URLRewrite Mediator"},{"location":"references/uRLRewrite-Mediator/#urlrewrite-mediator","text":"The URLRewrite Mediator is used to modify and transform the URL values available in messages.

If no property is entered, the transformations will be applied to the To header of the message. The Rewrite mediator applies the URL transformations by evaluating a set of rules on the message. To add a rule to the mediator, click Add Rule . The rewrite rule will be added to the mediator tree as a child of the URLRewrite mediator. Click URLRewriteRule in the mediator to configure the rewrite rule you added. A rule can consist of one or more rewrite actions and an optional condition. The Condition parameter is used to enter the optional condition. If a condition is specified, it will be evaluated before the rewrite actions, and the rewrite actions will be executed only if the condition evaluates to true . A rewrite action is added by clicking Add Action which would display a row. The parameters available to configure a rewrite action are as follows. Parameter Name Description Action This parameter is used to specify the action to be performed by the rewrite action. Each rewrite action is performed on a fragment entered in the Fragment parameter. Possible values are as follows. Replace : If this is selected, the existing in property value fragment will be replaced by the result value. Remove : If this is selected, the result value will be removed from the in property value fragment. Append : If this is selected, the result value will be added to the end of the in property value fragment. Prepend : If this is selected, the result value will be added to the beginning of the in property value fragment. Set : If this is selected, the result value will be set as the in property value fragment. Fragment The fragment of the in property (i.e. input URL) for which the rewrite action should be performed. The available fragments are as follows. Protocol : Host Port Path Query Ref User Full !!! info Note that this breakdown is inline with the URI specification (RFC2396). URL rewrite mediator enables rewriting each of the above segments separately and finally combining them to get the final URL value. It also supports rewriting the entire URL string at once. Option This parameter is used to define the result value of the rewrite action. Select one of the following. Value : If this is selected, the result value would be a static value. Expression : If this is selected, the result value will be evaluated using an expression. Value/Expression This parameter is used to enter the result value of the URLRewrite mediator as a static value or an expression, depending on what you selected for the Option parameter. Namespace Editor You can click this link to add namespaces when you are providing an expression. Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Regex This parameter is used to specify which part of the in property value fragment should be replaced by the result value if you selected Replace for the Action parameter. Delete Click Delete in the relevant row to remove a rewrite action.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"references/uRLRewrite-Mediator/#example","text":"In this example, the URLRewrite mediator has a rewrite action which replaces the value soap with value services in the fragment path of the input URL. Since no in property or an out property is specified, the To header of the request is both the input to which the rewrite rule is applied and the target where the result URL is set. This configuration is typically used when the address URL of a request contains the context soap which needs to be converted since all the services are deployed under a context named services in the EI server.

Tip A Fault mediator should be added as a child to the Validate mediator in order specify the fault sequence to be followed if the validation fails. Info The Validate mediator is a content aware mediator. Syntax \u00b6 <validate [source=\"xpath\"]> <property name=\"validation-feature-id\" value=\"true|false\"/>* <schema key=\"string\"/>+ <on-fail> mediator+ </on-fail> </validate> Configuration \u00b6 The mediator configuration can be divided into the following sections. Schema keys defined for Validate Mediator \u00b6 This section is used to specify the key to access the main schema based on which validation is carried out, as well as to specify the XML which needs to be validated. The parameters available in this section are as follows. Parameter Name Description Source The XPath expression to extract the XML that needs to be validated. The Validate mediator validates the evaluation of this expression against the schema specified in the Schema keys defined for Validate Mediator table. If this is not specified, the validation is performed against the first child of the SOAP body of the current message. !!! info Tip You can click NameSpaces to add namespaces if you are providing an expression. Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Enable Cache Schema This check box is enabled by default to ensure that schemas retrieved from the registry for one service/REST API are cached for future use. !!! tip Using Templates? Be sure to disable this check box if you are using the Validate mediator inside a Template . Since multiple proxy services/REST APIs will be accessing one template, schemas that are cached for one service can interrupt another service that uses the same template. Schema keys defined for Validate Mediator table The key for the schema location. It can be specified using one of the following methods. If the key is a static value, select Static Key from the list and enter a static key in the data field. This value should be pre-defined and saved as a resource in the Registry. Click either Configuration Registry or Governance Registry as relevant to select the required key from the resource tree. If the key is a dynamic value, Select Dynamic Key from the list and enter an expression to calculate the value in the data field. Click Add Key to add a new schema key. Click Delete in the relevant row to delete a schema key. !!! info Tip You can click NameSpaces to add namespaces if you are providing an expression. Then the Namespace Editor panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression. Features Defined for Validator Mediator \u00b6 This section is used to specify which features of the Validate mediator should be enabled and which should be disabled. The parameters available in this section are as follows. Info Only the FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING feature is currently supported by the validator. Parameter Name Description Feature Name The name of the feature. Value Click True to enable the feature, or click False to disable the feature. Action Click Delete in the relevant row to delete a feature. Resources of the Validate Mediator \u00b6 A resource in the Validate mediator configuration enables you to import a schema referenced within another schema. In order to access such a schema via a resource, the parent schema should be saved as a resource in the Registry. The parameters available in this section are as follows. Parameter Name Description Location The location of the schema to be imported. The value entered here should be equal to the value of the schema location attribute within the relevant < xsd:import > element in the parent schema. Key The key to access the parent schema saved in the Registry. Click either Configuration Registry or Governance Registry as relevant to select the key from the resource tree. Examples \u00b6 Example 1 - Basic configuration \u00b6 In this example, the required schema for validating messages going through the validate mediator is given as a registry key, schema\\sample.xsd . No source attribute is specified, and therefore the schema will be used to validate the first child of the SOAP body. The mediation logic to follow if the validation fails is defined within the on-fail element. In this example, the Fault Mediator creates a SOAP fault to be sent back to the party which sent the message. <validate cache-schema=\"true\"> <schema key=\"schema\\sample.xsd\"/> <on-fail> <makefault> <code value=\"tns:Receiver\" xmlns:tns=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\"/> <reason value=\"Invalid Request!!!\"/> </makefault> <property name=\"RESPONSE\" value=\"true\"/> <header name=\"To\" expression=\"get-property('ReplyTo')\"/> </on-fail> </validate> Example 2 - Validate mediator with resources \u00b6 In this example, the following schema named 08MockServiceSchema is saved in the Registry. This schema is located in MockDataTypes.xsd . A reference is made within this schema to another schema named 08SOAPFaults which is located in SOAPFaults.xsd . <xsd:import namespace= \"http://samples.synapse.com/08MockServiceSchema\" schemalocation= \"MockDataTypes.xsd\"> <xsd:import namespace= \"http://samples.synapse.com/08SOAPFaults\" schemalocation= \"../Common/SOAPFaults.xsd\"> </xsd:import> The Validate mediator can be configured as follows. <validate cache-schema=\"true\"> <schema key=\"MockDataTypes.xsd\"/> <resource location=\"../Common/SOAPFaults.xsd\" key=\"conf:custom/schema/SOAPFaults.xsd\"/> <on-fail> <log level=\"custom\"> <property name=\"validation failed\" value=\"Validation failed ###\"/> <property name=\"error_msg\" expression=\"$ctx:ERROR_MESSAGE\"/> </log> </on-fail> </validate> The schema used by the validate mediator is MockDataTypes.xsd . In addition, a resource is used to import the 08 SOAPFaults schema which is referred in the 08MockServiceSchema schema. Note that the value ../Common/SOAPFaults.xsd which is specified as the location for the schema to be imported is the same as the location specified for 08 SOAPFaults schema in the 08MockServiceSchema configuration. The on-fail sequence of this Validate mediator includes a Log mediator which is added as a child to the Validate mediator. This log mediator uses two properties to generate the error message Validation failed ### when the validation of a message against the schemas specified fails. The Validate mediator validates JSON messages against a specified JSON schema. You can specify a JSONPath to extract and validate a specific part of the message. Otherwise, the mediator validates the complete content of the current message. Tip A Fault mediator or PayloadFactory mediator should be added as a child to the Validate mediator in order specify the fault sequence to be followed if the validation fails. Info The Validate mediator is a content aware mediator.

It is intended to be the authoritative specification. Implementations of schemas for the Data Mapper mediator must adhere to this. Schema declaration Primitive types Complex types Defining WSO2 schemas to represent an XML payload Schema declaration \u00b6 A schema is represented in JSON by one of: A JSON string, naming a defined type. A JSON object, of the form: {\"type\": \"typeName\" ...attributes...} , where typeName is either a primitive or a derived type name, as defined below. A JSON array, representing a union of embedded types. A Data Mapper schema should start with the $schema attribute with the Data Mapper schema version. For example: { \u201c$schema\u201d:\u201d http://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema/1.0v \u201d} Also, it can contain following optional attributes that will define more information about the schema. \u201cid\u201d : a JSON string declaring a unique identifier for the schema. \u201ctitle\u201d : a JSON string defining the root element name. \u201cdescription\u201d : a JSON string providing a detailed description about the schema. \u201ctype\u201d : a JSON string providing the element type. \u201cnamespaces\u201d : a JSON array of JSON objects defining namespaces and prefix values used in the schema as shown in the following example. { \u201c$schema\u201d : \u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema/1.0v\u201d, \u201cid\u201d:\u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema-sample-o1\u201d, \u201ctitle\u201d:\u201dRootElement\u201d, \"type\":\"object\", \u201cdescription\u201d:\u201dThis schema represent any form of object without any restriction\u201d , \"namespaces\":[ { \"prefix\":\"ns1\", \"url\":\"http://ns1.com\"}, {\"prefix\":\"ns2\", \"url\":\"http://ns2.com\"}] } Primitive types \u00b6 Primitive types have no specified attributes. The set of primitive type names are as follows. null : no value boolean : a binary value integer : integer value number : rational numbers string : unicode character sequence Primitive type names are also defined type names. Thus, for example, the schema \"string\" is equivalent to: {\"type\": \"string\"} Complex types \u00b6 The Data Mapper schema supports the following complex types: object and array. Object \u00b6 Object uses the type name \u201cobject\u201d , and supports the following attributes. \u201cid\u201d : a JSON string declaring a unique identifier for the object (required). \u201ctype\u201d : a JSON string providing the element type. \u201cdescription\u201d : a JSON string providing documentation to the user of this schema. \u201cproperties\u201d : a JSON object listing fields (required). Each field is a JSON object. \u201cattributes\u201d : a JSON object listing XML attribute fields. Each field is a JSON object. Arrays \u00b6 Arrays use the type name \"array\" , and support a single attribute out of the following. \u201citems\u201d : the schema representing the items of the of the array. \u201cid\u201d : a JSON string declaring a unique identifier for the object (required). \u201cattributes\u201d : a JSON object listing XML attribute fields. Each field is a JSON object. \u201cdescription\u201d : a JSON string providing documentation to the user of this schema For example, an array of an object containing a field named firstname is declared as shown below. { \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": [ { \"id\":\"http://jsonschema.net/employee/0\", \"type\":\"object\", \"properties\":{ \u201cfirstname\":{ \"id\":\"http://jsonschema.net/employee/0/firstname\", \"type\":\"string\" } } }] } Defining WSO2 schemas to represent an XML payload \u00b6 There are differences between XML and JSON message specifications. Therefore, to represent XML message formats in JSON schemas, you need to introduce a few more configurations as explained below. Representing XML attributes and namespaces in WSO2 JSON schemas \u00b6 For example, you can build a JSON schema, which follows the WSO2 specification using the following XML code as described below. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <ns:employees xmlns:ns=\"http://wso2.employee.info\" xmlns:sn=\"http://wso2.employee.address\"> <ns:employee> <ns:firstname>Mark</ns:firstname> <ns:lastname>Taylor</ns:lastname> <sn:addresses> <sn:address location=\"home\"> <sn:city postalcode=\"30000\">LA</sn:city> <sn:road>baker street</sn:road> </sn:address> <sn:address location=\"office\"> <sn:city postalcode=\"10003\">Colombo 03</sn:city> <sn:road>duplication road</sn:road> </sn:address> </sn:addresses> </ns:employee> <ns:employee> <ns:firstname>Mathew</ns:firstname> <ns:lastname>Hayden</ns:lastname> <sn:addresses> <sn:address location=\"home\"> <sn:city postalcode=\"60000\">Sydney</sn:city> <sn:road>101 street</sn:road> </sn:address> <sn:address location=\"office\"> <sn:city postalcode=\"10003\">Colombo 03</sn:city> <sn:road>duplication road</sn:road> </sn:address> </sn:addresses> </ns:employee> </ns:employees Info WSO2 Data Mapper supports o nly single rooted XML messages. In the above example, employees is the root element of the payload, and it should be the value of the title element. Also, there are two namespace values used. Those should be listed under the namespaces field with any prefix value. Info Prefix value can be any valid string that contains only [a-z,A-Z,0-1] characters. You need not match them with the prefix values of the sample. When you include above information, the schema will be as follows. Info The \"required\" field specifies the fields that are mandatory to contain in that level of schema. { \u201c$schema\u201d : \u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema/1.0v\u201d, \u201cid\u201d:\u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema-sample-o1\u201d, \u201ctitle\u201d:\u201demployees\u201d, \"type\":\"object\", \u201cdescription\u201d:\u201dThis schema represent wso2 employee xml message format\u201d , \"required\":[ \"employees\" ], \"namespaces\":[ { \"prefix\":\"ns1\", \"url\":\"http://wso2.employee.info\"}, {\"prefix\":\"ns2\", \"url\":\"http://wso2.employee.address\"}] } Including the child elements and attribute values \u00b6 Define child elements under the \u201dproperties\u201d field as a JSON object with fields to describe the child element. In the above employee example, the employees element contains an array of similar employee elements. Hence, this can be represented as the following schema. { \u201c$schema\u201d : \u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema/1.0v\u201d, \u201cid\u201d:\u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema-sample-employees\u201d, \u201ctitle\u201d:\u201demployees\u201d, \"type\":\"object\", \u201cdescription\u201d:\u201dThis schema represent wso2 employee xml message format\u201d , \u201cproperties\u201d: { \u201cemployee\u201d:{ \"id\":\"http://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema-sample-employees/employee\", \"type\":\"array\", \u201cItems\u201d:[ ], \"required\":[ \"arrayRequired\" ] } }, \"required\":[ \"employees\" ], \"namespaces\":[ { \"prefix\":\"ns1\", \"url\":\"http://wso2.employee.info\"}, {\"prefix\":\"ns2\", \"url\":\"http://wso2.employee.address\"}] } Since the employee element is an array type element, it contains a field named \u201citems\u201d , which defines the element format of the array of employee elements. It contains three child fields as firstname , lastname , and address with string, string, and object types accordingly. Hence, when you include these elements into the schema, it will look as the following schema. { \u201c$schema\u201d : \u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema/1.0v\u201d, \u201cid\u201d:\u201dhttp://wso2-data-mapper-json-schema-sample-employees\u201d, \u201ctitle\u201d:\u201demployees\u201d, \"type\":\"object\", \u201cdescription\u201d:\u201dThis schema represent wso2 employee xml message format\u201d , \u201cproperties\u201d: { \u201cemployee\u201d:{ \"id\":\"http:/\u2026.employees/employee\", \"type\":\"array\", \u201cItems\u201d:[{ \"id\":\"http://jsonschema.net/employee/0\", \"type\":\"object\", \"properties\":{ \"firstname\":{ \"id\":\"http://.../employee/firstname\", \"type\":\"string\" }, \"lastname\":{ \"id\":\"http://.../employee/lastname\", \"type\":\"string\" }, \"addresses\":{ \"id\":\"http://.../employee//addresses\", \"type\":\"object\", \"properties\":{ \"address\":{ \"id\":\"http://.../employee/ addresses/address\", \"type\":\"array\", \"Items\":[ \u2026 ] } } } }, \"required\":[ \"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"address\" ] } ], \"required\":[\"arrayRequired\" ] } }, \"required\":[\"employees\" ], \"namespaces\":[ { \"prefix\":\"ns1\", \"url\":\"http://wso2.employee.info\"}, {\"prefix\":\"ns2\", \"url\":\"http://wso2.employee.address\"}] } Define the XML attributes under the \u201cattributes\u201d field similar to the \"properties in the element definition.

A mediator can take a message, carry out some predefined actions on it, and output the modified message. For example, the Clone mediator splits a message into several clones, the Send mediator sends the messages, and the Aggregate mediator collects and merges the responses before sending them back to the client. The ESB profile ships with a range of mediators capable of carrying out various tasks on input messages, including functionality to match incompatible protocols, data formats and interaction patterns across different resources. Data can be split, cloned, aggregated, and enriched, allowing the ESB profile to match the different capabilities of services. XQuery and XSLT allow rich transformations on the messages. Rule-based message mediation allows users to cope with the uncertainty of business logic. Content-based routing using XPath filtering is supported in different flavors, allowing users to get the most convenient configuration experience. Built-in capability to handle Transactions allows message mediation to be done transactionally inside the ESB profile . With the eventing capabilities of the ESB profile , EDA based components can be easily interconnected, allowing the ESB profile to be used in the front-end of an organisation's SOA infrastructure. Mediators A mediator is a full-powered processing unit in the ESB profile . In run-time it has access to all parts of the ESB profile along with the current message. Usually, a mediator is configured using XML. Different mediators have their own XML configurations. At the run-time, a message is injected in to the mediator with the ESB profile information. Then this mediator can do virtually anything with the message. A user can write a mediator and put it into the ESB profile . This custom mediator and any other built-in mediator will be exactly the same as the API and the privileges (Refer to more information in Creating Custom Mediators ). Refer to ESB Mediators . Mediation Sequence A mediation sequence, commonly called a \"sequence\", is a list of mediators. That means, it can hold other mediators and execute them. It is part of the ESB profile 's core and message mediation cannot live without this mediator. When a message is delivered to a sequence, it sends the message through all its child mediators. Read more in Mediation Sequences . The Process of Message Mediation \u00b6 In case an error occurs in the main sequence while processing, the message goes to the fault sequence.

For example, the Clone mediator splits a message into several clones, the Send mediator sends the messages, and the Aggregate mediator collects and merges the responses before sending them back to the client. The ESB profile ships with a range of mediators capable of carrying out various tasks on input messages, including functionality to match incompatible protocols, data formats and interaction patterns across different resources. Data can be split, cloned, aggregated, and enriched, allowing the ESB profile to match the different capabilities of services. XQuery and XSLT allow rich transformations on the messages. Rule-based message mediation allows users to cope with the uncertainty of business logic. Content-based routing using XPath filtering is supported in different flavors, allowing users to get the most convenient configuration experience. Built-in capability to handle Transactions allows message mediation to be done transactionally inside the ESB profile . With the eventing capabilities of the ESB profile , EDA based components can be easily interconnected, allowing the ESB profile to be used in the front-end of an organisation's SOA infrastructure. Mediators A mediator is a full-powered processing unit in the ESB profile . In run-time it has access to all parts of the ESB profile along with the current message. Usually, a mediator is configured using XML. Different mediators have their own XML configurations. At the run-time, a message is injected in to the mediator with the ESB profile information. Then this mediator can do virtually anything with the message. A user can write a mediator and put it into the ESB profile . This custom mediator and any other built-in mediator will be exactly the same as the API and the privileges (Refer to more information in Creating Custom Mediators ). Refer to ESB Mediators . Mediation Sequence A mediation sequence, commonly called a \"sequence\", is a list of mediators. That means, it can hold other mediators and execute them. It is part of the ESB profile 's core and message mediation cannot live without this mediator. When a message is delivered to a sequence, it sends the message through all its child mediators.

This section describes how to create a new sequence or import an existing sequence from an XML file (such as a Synapse Configuration file), and how to use the sequence in your mediation flow. About dynamic sequences \u00b6 WSO2 Integration Studio allows you to create a Registry Resource project, which can be used to store Resources and Collections you want to deploy to the registry of a Carbon Server through a Composite Application (C-App) project. When you create a sequence, you can save it as a dynamic sequence in the Registry Resource project and refer to that sequence from the mediation flow. At runtime, when you deploy the CAR file with both the Registry Resource project and mediation flow, the ESB profile looks up and uses the sequence from the registry. Creating a new sequence \u00b6 Follow these steps to create a new, reusable sequence that you can add to your mediation workflow or refer to from a sequence mediator, or to create a sequence mediator and its underlying sequence all at once. To create a reusable sequence: Create an ESB Config project: Open WSO2 Integration Studio , click ****Miscellaneous \u2192 Create New Config Project **** in the ****Getting Started**** tab, and follow the instructions on the wizard. {width=\"800\" height=\"397\"} Right-click the ESB Config project on the project explorer, click Sequence .

This essentially defines the per-message context passed through the chain of mediators, for each and every message received and processed by Synapse. Each message instance is wrapped within a MessageContext instance, and the message context is set with the references to the SynapseConfiguration and SynapseEnvironment . The SynapseConfiguration holds the global configuration model that defines mediation rules, local registry entries and other configuration. The SynapseEnvironment gives access to the underlying SOAP implementation used - Apache Axis2. A typical mediator would need to manipulate the MessageContext by referring to the SynapseConfiguration . Info Note It is strongly recommended that the SynapseConfiguration is not updated by mediator instances as it is shared by all messages and may be updated by Synapse administration or configuration modules. Mediator instances may store local message properties into the MessageContext for later retrieval by successive mediators.

The purpose of this interface is to capture a message as it flows through the system. As you see the message payload is represented using the SOAP infoset. Binary messages can be embedded in the Envelope using MTOM (SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) or SwA (SOAP with Attachments) using the AXIOM (AXis Object Model) object model.

If the mediate() method returns \"false\", it signals to the Synapse processing model to stop further processing of the message. For example, if the mediator is a security agent, it may decide that this message is dangerous and should not be processed further. This is generally the exception as mediators are usually designed to co-operate to process the message onwards. Leaf and Node Mediators, List Mediators and Filter Mediators \u00b6 Mediators may be Node mediators (they can contain child mediators) or Leaf mediators (mediators that does not hold any other child mediators).

Properties of the XSLT mediator This section is used to inject properties set in the mediation flow to the XSLT script as XSLT parameters. These are referred from the XSLT in transformation using the get-property(prop-name) XPath extension function. Parameters relating to the properties are as follows. Property Name : The name of the property to be passed into the transformations. Property Type : This specifies whether the property is given as a static value or an XPath expression. Value/Expression - This defines the static value or the XPath expression. Action - This parameter allows the property to be removed from the XSLT script if required. !!! info For example, define the transform.xslt.result.disableBuild property as shown below, to escape building the message at the XSLT transformation. It avoids replacing encoded values with real characters. E.g., If you do not add this property, \" &#10; \" in your XML content will be replaced by a new line, when the XML content is built at the XSLT mediator. Features of the XSLT mediator This section is used to specify features to be enabled/disabled in the XSLT transformation. For example, adding the http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse/transform/feature/dom feature turns on DOM-based transformations instead of serializing elements into byte streams and/or temporary files. This approach can improve performance but might not work for all transformations. Parameters relating to the features are as follows. Feature Name : The name of the feature to be enabled/disabled in the XSLT transformation. Feature Value : This specified whether the feature is enabled or not. Select True to enable the feature or False to disable it. Action : This allows you to remove the feature from the XSLT transformation if required. Resources of the XSLT mediator This section is used to import external XSLT scripts to the main XSLT scripts defined in the XSLT mediator. The XSLT scripts to be imported are first added as resources in the registry. Parameters relating to the resources are as follows. Location : The location where the XSLT script to be imported is saved as a resource. Key : The registry key to which the XSLT should be referred. Browse for the relevant key in the Configuration registry or the Governance registry. Action : This allows you to remove the imported XSLT script added as a resource if required. Examples \u00b6 Example 1 - Applying a XSLT transformation to a element selected based on an XPath expression Example 2 - Adding properties as XSLT parameters Example 3 - Adding XSLT imports as resources Example 4 - Adding CDATA to be displayed in the output Example 1 - Applying a XSLT transformation to a element selected based on an XPath expression \u00b6 In this example, the XSLT can be picked by the key transform/example.xslt and the XSLT would be applied to a part of the message that is specified as an XPath expression. In this case, it is applied to s11:Body/child the message. <xslt xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\" key=\"transform/example.xslt\" source=\"s11:Body/child\" /> Example 2 - Adding properties as XSLT parameters \u00b6 In this example, a property named PARAM_NAME is added to the XSLT script as an XSLT parameter. A XPath expression is used to assign this property the value of the ORDER_ID property in the default scope. <xslt key=\"keyToXSLTFile\"> <property expression=\"$ctx:ORDER_ID\" name=\"PARAM_NAME\"> </property></xslt> The XSLT script with the PARAM_NAME property added would look as follows. <xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"> <xsl:param name=\"PARAM_NAME\"></xsl:param> <xsl:template match=\"/\"> <orders xmlns=\"http://services.samples\"> <xsl:attribute name=\"id\"> <xsl:value-of select=\"$PARAM_NAME\"> </xsl:value-of></xsl:attribute> </orders> </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> Example 3 - Adding XSLT imports as resources \u00b6 In this example, two XSLT files saved in the registry under conf:/ as resources are imported to the main XSLT script of the XSLT mediator. xslt1.xslt <xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"> <xsl:template match=\"//people/person\" name=\"FILL_PPL\"> <client> <firstname> <xsl:value-of select=\"firstname\"> </xsl:value-of></firstname> <lastname> <xsl:value-of select=\"lastname\"> </xsl:value-of></lastname> <age> <xsl:value-of select=\"age\"> </xsl:value-of></age> <country> <xsl:value-of select=\"country\"> </xsl:value-of></country> </client> </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> xslt2.xslt <xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"> <xsl:import href=\"xslt1.xslt\" /> <xsl:template match=\"/\"> <clients> <xsl:for-each select=\"//people/person\"> <xsl:call-template name=\"FILL_PPL\"></xsl:call-template> </xsl:for-each> </clients> </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> \\<xsl:include href=\"xslt1.xslt\"> element indicates that the xslt1.xslt is included in xslt2.xslt .

Create a file named XMLInputFactory.properties inside the <EI_HOME> directory, and include the following property in it: javax.xml.stream.isCoalescing= false Add the <xsl:output method=\"xml\" omit-xml-declaration=\"yes\" indent=\"yes\"/> attribute to the XSL stylesheet. In the XSL stylesheet, wrap the encoded CDATA within the <xsl:text> elements with the disable-output-escaping=\"yes\" parameter as shown below. <xsl:text disable-output-escaping=\"yes\">&lt;![CDATA[</xsl:text> <xsl:copy-of select=\"*\"/> <xsl:text disable-output-escaping=\"yes\">]]&gt;</xsl:text> The following is an example of a XSL stylesheet, which includes CDATA to be displayed in the output. <xsl:stylesheet version=\"2.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"> <xsl:output method=\"xml\" omit-xml-declaration=\"yes\" indent=\"yes\"/> <xsl:template match=\"/\"> <root> <xsl:copy> <xsl:text disable-output-escaping=\"yes\">&lt;![CDATA[</xsl:text> <xsl:copy-of select=\"*\"/> <xsl:text disable-output-escaping=\"yes\">]]&gt;</xsl:text> </xsl:copy> </root> </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> You can use the following Synapse configuration to process the above XSL stylesheet via a XSLT mediator.

The recommendations in this topic are for general production use, assuming moderate load conditions. For situations where a high volume of traffic is expected and if there are large deployments, these guidelines may not be sufficient. See Troubleshooting in Production Environments for information on how to obtain and analyze information to solve production issues. The following are the topics addressed in this section. Common guidelines and checklist \u00b6 The following table lists out the common guidelines and details pertaining to them. These are common to all products and are followed for making an installed WSO2 product ready for production. Guideline Details Security hardening Guidelines for hardening the security of a WSO2 deployment in a production environment can be discussed under three high-level categories: Product-level security OS-level security Network-level security Related links See Security Guidelines for Production Deployment for the detailed list of security-related recommendations. Hostname By default, WSO2 products identify the hostname of the current machine through the Java API. However, this value sometimes yields erroneous results on some environments. Therefore, users are recommended to configure the hostname by setting the HostName parameter in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml file. <HostName> your.host.name </HostName> To configure hostnames for WSDLs and endpoints, users are recommended to add the following parameter in the <transportReceiver> section in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file as shown below. <parameter name= \"WSDLEPRPrefix\" locked= \"false\" > [http]://your.host.name:[port] </parameter> Related links See the topics on changing hostnames shown below: Setting up hostnames and ports Changing the hostname See Working with Transports for information on transports in WSO2 products. Registry and governance All WSO2 products make use of an instance of a registry to store configurations. The registry uses a database as the persistent storage. By default, the registry uses an embedded H2 database. This embedded database might yield a lower performance and is less reliable compared to a standard database like MySQL when there are a large number of deployed artifacts. Hence, you should look at associated trade-offs, and we recommend that you switch to a database like Oracle, MySQL or MSSQL. Moreover, it is worth noting that the default setup does not include database backup procedures. The production setup should obviously need to have regular database backup procedures configured. When the registry database is pointed to a remote database, multiple running instances of the same product can boot up and run against the same configuration stored in the registry. This, in turn, helps with governance. Related links See here for more information on sharing a registry space across multiple WSO2 product instances. User stores WSO2 products offer three choices to store user details: Using a database Using an LDAP server Using an Active Directory service The default is to use the embedded H2 database, with the user store schema. Like in the case of the registry database, you can switch to a database like Oracle, MySQL or MSSQL. You can point to an existing LDAP or an Active Directory to make use of existing user bases and grant access privileges for WSO2 products based on those user stores. Related links See Configuring User Stores for more information on user stores, how they work, and how to configure them. Monitoring with JMX WSO2 Products supportJMXformonitoring. By default, JMX uses port 9999. You can configure this to the desired port by setting the JMX port parameter in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml file. <Ports> <JMX> 9999 </JMX> </Ports> Related links See JMX-Based Monitoring for information on monitoring WSO2 products using JMX. Tuning WSO2 products Most of the performance tuning recommendations are common to all WSO2 products. However, each WSO2 product may have additional guidelines for optimizing the performance of product-specific features. Related links See Performance Tuning for the general guidelines, which are common to all WSO2 products. For performance tuning guidelines that are specific to each product, go to the product documentation for each product listed below and search for performance tuning guidelines. Listed below are the main WSO2 products: API Manager Data Analytics Server Enterprise Integrator profiles ESB profile Business Process Management profile Message Broker profile Analytics profile Micro Integrator profile IOT Server Identity Server Enterprise Service Bus The following are now legacy products of WSO2: Application Server Business Rules Server Enterprise Mobility Manager Enterprise Store Governance Registry Firewalls The following ports must be accessed when operating within a firewall. 9443 - Used by the management console and services that use the servlet transport, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml file. 9763 - Used by the services that use servlet transport, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml file. 9999 - Used for JMX monitoring, defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml file. 8280 - Default HTTP port used by ESB for proxy services, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file. 8243 - Default HTTPS port used by ESB for proxy services, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file. Related links See Default Ports of WSO2 Products for a list of common and product-specific ports used by WSO2 products. Proxy servers If the product is hosted behind a proxy such as ApacheHTTPD, users can configure products to use the proxy server by providing the following system properties at the start-up. -Dhttp. proxyHost =xxxx -Dhttp. proxyPort =xxxx Alternatively, this can be done by adding the following configurations in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file. <parameter name= \"Proxy\" > <Configuration> <proxyhost> you.proxy.host </proxyhost> <proxyport> your.proxy.port </proxyport> </configuration> </parameter> High availability For high availability, WSO2 products must run on a cluster . This enables the WSO2 products to still work in the case of failover. Databases used for the repository, user management, and business activity monitoring can also be configured in a cluster or can use replication management provided by the RDBMS. Related links See Overview for more details on clustering, what it is, how it helps and other related information. See Separating the Worker and Manager Nodes for information on clustering WSO2 products by separating worker and manager concerns between the nodes. Data backup and archiving For data backup and for archiving of data, use the functionality provided by the RDBMS. Security guidelines and checklist \u00b6 Given below are the common security guidelines for deploying a WSO2 product in a production environment. Also, see the production deployment guidelines and any other product-specific guidelines that might come in the respective product's documentation. WSO2 product-level security \u00b6 Guideline Details Apply security updates Apply all the security patches relevant to your product version. If your WSO2 product version is supported by WSO2 Update Manager (WUM), you need to use WUM to get the latest fixes. If your WSO2 product is listed as a WUM-supported product here , follow the instructions in Getting Started with WUM . If you are using an older WSO2 product version, which is not WUM-supported, you need to download the security patches relevant to your product from the WSO2 Security Patch Release page and apply them to your system manually. The instructions are given in WSO2 Patch Application Process . !!! note Note the following: WSO2 releases security patch notifications monthly via the Support Portal and the above mentioned WSO2 Security Patch Releases page. However, for highly critical issues, patches are issued immediately to customers. The WSO2 Security Patch Release page has all the security patches for the latest product versions. WSO2 does not issue patches publicly for older product versions. Community users are encouraged to use the latest product version to receive all the security fixes. Change default keystores Change the default key stores and create new keys for all the cryptographic operations. WSO2 products by default come with a self-signed SSL key. Since these keys are public, it is recommended to configure your own keys for security purposes. Consider the following guidelines when creating the keystores: Select a key size of at least 2048 bits. Use an SHA256 certificate. Make sure that WSO2 default certificates do not exist in any of the keystores in your production environment. For example, be sure to delete the default public certificate in the default trust store that is shipped with the product. See the recommendations for using keystores in WSO2 products for information. See Creating New Keystores for information on how to create and configure your own keys. Encrypt passwords in configuration files WSO2 products use a tool called Secure Vault to encrypt the plain-text passwords in configuration files. See Securing Passwords in Configuration Files for instructions. Change default ports All the default ports used by WSO2 products are listed in Default Ports of WSO2 Products . For example, the default HTTPS port is 9443 and the HTTP port is 9763. Also, Axis2 services are exposed over the following ports: 8243 and 8280. To change a default port, update the <Offset> element in the carbon. xml file as explained in Changing the Default Ports . Enable read-only access to external user stores (LDAPs etc.) If your WSO2 product is connecting to an external user store, such as Microsoft Active Directory, for the purpose of reading and retrieving user information, be sure to enable read-only access to that user store. For example, see Configuring a Read-Only LDAP User Store under Configuring User Stores for instructions. Always communicate (with external user stores) over TLS All connections from your WSO2 product to external databases, userstores (LDAP), or other services, should be over TLS, to ensure adequate network-level protection. Therefore, be sure to use external systems (user stores, databases) that are TLS-enabled. Connect to data stores using a less privileged user When connecting the WSO2 product to external databases or user stores (LDAP), be sure to go through a user who does not have permission to change the data store's schema. Be sure not to use the root user of the data store because all permissions are generally granted to the root user. Configure strong HTTP(S) security To have strong transport-level security, use TLS 1.2 and disable SSL, TLS 1.0 and 1.1. The TLS protocol and strong ciphers are configured for an HTTP connector in the catalina -server. xml file (using the sslEnabledProtocols and ciphers attributes). See the following links for instructions: Configuring Transport-Level Security Supported Cipher Suites !!! note Note the following: When deciding on the TLS protocol and the ciphers, consider the compatibility with existing client applications. Imposing maximum security might cause functional problems with client applications. Apply ciphers with 256 bits key length if you have applied the Unlimited strength policy. Note that Unlimited strength policy is recommended. Also, consider the following factors when deciding on the ciphers: DES/3DES are deprecated and should not be used. MD5 should not be used, due to known collision attacks. RC4 should not be used, due to crypto-analytical attacks. DSS is limited to a small 1024 bit key size. Cipher-suites that do not provide Perfect Forward Secrecy/ Forward Secrecy (PFS/FS). GCM based ciphers are recommended over CBC ciphers. Remove weak ciphers for PassThrough transport !!! note Applicable only to products that use the PassThrough transport, such as WSO2 API Manager and WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (ESB profile). Remove any weak ciphers from the PassThrough transport and ensure that the server does not accept connections using those weak ciphers. The PassThrough transport is configured using the axis2. xml file (stored in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/ directory. You need to add the PreferredCiphers parameter under the \"Transport Ins (Listeners)\" section along with the list of relevant cipher suites. See Configuring the PassThrough Transport for instructions. Update the HTTP Response header \"Server\" value By default, all WSO2 products pass \"WSO2 Carbon Server\" as the server value in HTTP headers when sending HTTP responses. This means that information about the WSO2 product stack will be exposed through HTTP responses. It is recommended to change this by configuring the server name in the catalina -server. xml file. See Configuring Transport Level Security for instructions. Enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security Headers (HSTS) Be sure that HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled for all the applications deployed in your WSO2 server. This includes the management console, and any other web applications and/or Jaggery applications. Note that (for products based on Carbon 4.4.11 or later versions) HSTS is disabled for the applications with which the product is shipped by default. This is because HSTS validation can interrupt the development processes by validating signatures of self-signed certificates. See the topic on Enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security Headers for instructions. Preventing browser caching If there are dynamic pages in your application with sensitive information, you need to prevent browser caching. This can be done by making sure that the applications deployed in your server will return the relevant HTTP response headers. Note that cache prevention headers are enabled for the applications with which the product is shipped by default. Therefore, you need to manually enable cache prevention headers only for all the new applications that you deploy in your server. See the topic on Preventing browser caching for instructions. Increase Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Key size Before starting the server, open the product startup script ( wso2server.sh in Linux and wso2server.bat in Windows) and enter the following with the other Java properties: -Djdk. tls . ephemeralDHKeySize = 2048 \\ Disable client-initiated renegotiation Before starting the server, open the product startup script ( wso2server.sh in Linux and wso2server.bat in Windows) and enter the following with the other Java properties: -Djdk. tls . rejectClientInitiatedRenegotiation = true \\ Enable HostName Verification If your product is using Carbon Kernel 4.4.17 or a later version, make sure that hostname verification is enabled in the product startup script ( wso2server.sh in Linux and wso2server.bat in Windows) with the Strict mode. That is, you need to enable the following parameter: -Dhttpclient. hostnameVerifier =Strict \\ In Carbon versions prior to 4.4.17, be sure that hostname verification is enabled by setting the following property to false . -Dorg. wso2 . ignoreHostnameVerification = false \\ See Enabling HostName Verification for instructions. Enable additional XSS Protection XSS attacks are prevented on the latest WSO2 products by default. This is due to output encoding of the displaying values. However, if additional protection is required, an input validation valve can be configured. See Mitigating Cross Site Scripting Attacks for instructions. Increase JSESSIONID length If required, increase the session ID length by changing the sessionIDLength attribute of the session manager in the context.xml file (stored in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/context.xml directory) as shown below. The default value is 16 bytes. <Manager className= \"org.wso2.carbon.webapp.mgt.CarbonTomcatSessionManager\" sessionIdLength= \"16\" ></Manager> Change default admin credentials All WSO2 products have the Administrator account configured by default. The default user nameand password of the administrator account is \"admin\". To change the administrator credentials, you need to first sign in tothe management console of the product as \"admin\", and then use the Change Password option under Home->Configure->User Management->Users in the navigator. See Changing a Password for more information on how to change the password of the administrator. Restrict access to the management console Make sure that the permission for signing into the management console is granted only to the users that need to use the management console. For example, in products such as WSO2 Identity Server and WSO2 API Manager, the majority of users only need to login to the connected service providers via the WSO2 product. Therefore, such users should not have permission to log into the management console. You can make sure that only administrative users have access to the product's management console. Further, instead of granting all permission to one administrator, you can distribute the responsibilities among administrators by assigning different permissions for conducting various tasks. See Managing Users, Roles and Permissions for instructions. Enable log rotation and monitoring Ensure that you have a relevant log rotation scheme to manage logs. Log4J properties for WSO2 products can be configured in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j.properties file. To roll the wso2carbon.log based on size, the following configurations can be used. log4j. appender . CARBON_LOGFILE =org. apache . log4j . RollingFileAppender log4j. appender . CARBON_LOGFILE =${carbon. home }/repository/logs/${instance. log }/wso2carbon${instance. log }. log log4j. appender . CARBON_LOGFILE . MaxFileSize =1000KB log4j. appender . CARBON_LOGFILE . MaxBackupIndex = 10 See Monitoring Logs for details on how to configure logging details in WSO2 products. Prevent Log Forging Log forging can be prevented by appending a UUID to the log message. See Monitoring Logs for more information on configuring the log4j.properties file. Set appropriate JVM parameters The recommended JDK version is JDK 1.7 or 1.8. See the installation pre-requisites for more information. For JDK 1.7, set the appropriate Heap and Permgen values for the JVM based on your deployment scenario. These can be set in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh file. You do not need to set this in JDK 1.8 as the MaxPermSize value has been removed from Hotspot JVM. For example -Xms512m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m !!! tip Tip : To run the JVM with 2 GB (-Xmx2048m), you should ideally have about 4GB of memory on the physical machine. OS-level security \u00b6 This section provides the list of OS-level security guidelines for your production environment. Guideline Details Run WSO2 processes with a specific OS-level user Use a separate OS-level user to run WSO2 products. Make sure that the user is only granted the permissions required for running the product for that particular user. Do not use the root/administrator user of your OS because the root/administrator is granted all privileges by default. Minimize software to avoid vulnerability Make sure that you only install the software/packages that are relevant to your WSO2 product's deployment. Also, continuously monitor the software that you install. See the Installation Prerequisites to identify the minimum software your WSO2 product will need. Enable the Firewall Enable a firewall at the OS level (for example, iptables ). This will provide protection for inbound and outbound connections of your WSO2 product. Make sure that you only open the required outbound and inbound ports from the OS-level firewall. Restrict access to TCP ports used for clustering Apply a firewall at host-level to disallow access to TCP ports used for clustering (port 4000, 4001, \u2026 by default) from unrecognized hosts. These ports should be accessible only from other members of the WSO2 product cluster. Use Secure Shell(SSH) Use Secure Shell (SSH) when interacting with servers and executing commands. Adhere to the following best practices when you configure SSH: Change the default ssh port to a higher value. Disable the root or administrator. Enable login with user keys. Display a legal banner or a security banner with security warnings before SSH authentication. Keep the system up-to-date If there are security updates available for the packages installed in your OS (including the Java runtime), be sure to perform the necessary testing in a staging environment, and then proceed to install them for your OS. Monitor user activities Monitor the activities of your OS users. You can do this by enabling OS-level logs and by reviewing them regularly. You can also set up a centralized log monitoring system for this purpose. Session Data Cleanup !!! note Note: This security guideline is specific only to WSO2 Identity Server. In a production environment, there is a possibility for a deadlock/database lock to occur when running a session data cleanup task in high load scenarios. To mitigate this, configure the following property to clean data in chunks. Configure this property in the <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/identity.xml file under <SessionDataCleanUp> with the required chunk size. This value is in the number of records and depends on the database type and server capacity. It also depends on the amount of load generated by single sign-on (SSO). A higher value increases the chances of deadlocks and a lower value increases the time it takes for a cleanup. <DeleteChunkSize> 50000 </DeleteChunkSize> For more information on configuring sessions in production, see Authentication Session Persistence in the WSO2 Identity Server documentation. Make regular backups Make sure to backup important files and archive them continuously. See Backup and Recovery Recommendations for more information. Network-level security \u00b6 This section provides the list of security guidelines for configuring the network. Guideline Details Create a failover setup When your WSO2 products are clustered, you need to regularly monitor the health of your server instances. For example, you need to monitor resource-level factors such as the server's resource utilization, response time anomalies, and the number of incoming network connections. Server monitoring will help you identify when additional server instances (failover instances) are required. You can also make decisions about network routing changes that you need to do in order to avoid server downtime. See Deployment and Clustering/Key Concepts for information on configuring failover. See Monitoring WSO2 products for information on the monitoring options for WSO2 products. Maintain network level logging Be sure to maintain and monitor logs for your proxy servers, load balancers, and other network devices. Check open ports and services Periodically check for open ports using port scanning tools and make sure that only the necessary ports are open to both internal and external networks. Be sure that only the ports relevant to your WSO2 products are open for communication. If there are other ports started, be sure to monitor them. See Default Ports of WSO2 Products for the full list of ports in all WSO2 products. Configure device-level security All your network devices should be periodically checked for anomalies. For example, you need to verify routing tables and firewall rules. Also, make sure that the default credentials are changed before the first use of those devices. Apply firmware updates Firmware updates for your network devices should be applied regularly. Block the /services and /carbon contexts from the DMZ Access to the \"/services\" and \"/carbon\" contexts should be blocked from the DMZ level (i.e., from the proxy server, load balancer and/or firewall). The \"/services\" context is used in WSO2 products to expose admin services. These admin services are used for performing administrative operations using SOAP requests. The \"/carbon\" context is used in WSO2 products to expose the management console (administration console) of the product. The management console is a user interface for performing some of the administrative operations of a product. In addition to the \"/services\" and \"/carbon\" contexts, be sure to expose only the required applications in your product to users beyond the DMZ level in your network. !!! note It is recommended to use a whitelisting approach when allowing access to resources in your product from the DMZ level.","title":"Product Deployment Checklist"},{"location":"setup/deployment_checklist/#production-deployment-guidelines","text":"The requirements for deploying WSO2 products can change based on the deployment scenario and pattern. The recommendations in this topic are for general production use, assuming moderate load conditions. For situations where a high volume of traffic is expected and if there are large deployments, these guidelines may not be sufficient. See Troubleshooting in Production Environments for information on how to obtain and analyze information to solve production issues. The following are the topics addressed in this section.","title":"Production Deployment Guidelines"},{"location":"setup/deployment_checklist/#common-guidelines-and-checklist","text":"The following table lists out the common guidelines and details pertaining to them. These are common to all products and are followed for making an installed WSO2 product ready for production. Guideline Details Security hardening Guidelines for hardening the security of a WSO2 deployment in a production environment can be discussed under three high-level categories: Product-level security OS-level security Network-level security Related links See Security Guidelines for Production Deployment for the detailed list of security-related recommendations. Hostname By default, WSO2 products identify the hostname of the current machine through the Java API. However, this value sometimes yields erroneous results on some environments. Therefore, users are recommended to configure the hostname by setting the HostName parameter in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml file. <HostName> your.host.name </HostName> To configure hostnames for WSDLs and endpoints, users are recommended to add the following parameter in the <transportReceiver> section in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file as shown below. <parameter name= \"WSDLEPRPrefix\" locked= \"false\" > [http]://your.host.name:[port] </parameter> Related links See the topics on changing hostnames shown below: Setting up hostnames and ports Changing the hostname See Working with Transports for information on transports in WSO2 products. Registry and governance All WSO2 products make use of an instance of a registry to store configurations. The registry uses a database as the persistent storage. By default, the registry uses an embedded H2 database. This embedded database might yield a lower performance and is less reliable compared to a standard database like MySQL when there are a large number of deployed artifacts. Hence, you should look at associated trade-offs, and we recommend that you switch to a database like Oracle, MySQL or MSSQL. Moreover, it is worth noting that the default setup does not include database backup procedures. The production setup should obviously need to have regular database backup procedures configured. When the registry database is pointed to a remote database, multiple running instances of the same product can boot up and run against the same configuration stored in the registry. This, in turn, helps with governance. Related links See here for more information on sharing a registry space across multiple WSO2 product instances. User stores WSO2 products offer three choices to store user details: Using a database Using an LDAP server Using an Active Directory service The default is to use the embedded H2 database, with the user store schema. Like in the case of the registry database, you can switch to a database like Oracle, MySQL or MSSQL. You can point to an existing LDAP or an Active Directory to make use of existing user bases and grant access privileges for WSO2 products based on those user stores. Related links See Configuring User Stores for more information on user stores, how they work, and how to configure them. Monitoring with JMX WSO2 Products supportJMXformonitoring. By default, JMX uses port 9999. You can configure this to the desired port by setting the JMX port parameter in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml file. <Ports> <JMX> 9999 </JMX> </Ports> Related links See JMX-Based Monitoring for information on monitoring WSO2 products using JMX. Tuning WSO2 products Most of the performance tuning recommendations are common to all WSO2 products. However, each WSO2 product may have additional guidelines for optimizing the performance of product-specific features. Related links See Performance Tuning for the general guidelines, which are common to all WSO2 products. For performance tuning guidelines that are specific to each product, go to the product documentation for each product listed below and search for performance tuning guidelines. Listed below are the main WSO2 products: API Manager Data Analytics Server Enterprise Integrator profiles ESB profile Business Process Management profile Message Broker profile Analytics profile Micro Integrator profile IOT Server Identity Server Enterprise Service Bus The following are now legacy products of WSO2: Application Server Business Rules Server Enterprise Mobility Manager Enterprise Store Governance Registry Firewalls The following ports must be accessed when operating within a firewall. 9443 - Used by the management console and services that use the servlet transport, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml file. 9763 - Used by the services that use servlet transport, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml file. 9999 - Used for JMX monitoring, defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml file. 8280 - Default HTTP port used by ESB for proxy services, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file. 8243 - Default HTTPS port used by ESB for proxy services, and is defined in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file. Related links See Default Ports of WSO2 Products for a list of common and product-specific ports used by WSO2 products. Proxy servers If the product is hosted behind a proxy such as ApacheHTTPD, users can configure products to use the proxy server by providing the following system properties at the start-up. -Dhttp. proxyHost =xxxx -Dhttp. proxyPort =xxxx Alternatively, this can be done by adding the following configurations in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml file. <parameter name= \"Proxy\" > <Configuration> <proxyhost> you.proxy.host </proxyhost> <proxyport> your.proxy.port </proxyport> </configuration> </parameter> High availability For high availability, WSO2 products must run on a cluster . This enables the WSO2 products to still work in the case of failover. Databases used for the repository, user management, and business activity monitoring can also be configured in a cluster or can use replication management provided by the RDBMS. Related links See Overview for more details on clustering, what it is, how it helps and other related information. See Separating the Worker and Manager Nodes for information on clustering WSO2 products by separating worker and manager concerns between the nodes. Data backup and archiving For data backup and for archiving of data, use the functionality provided by the RDBMS.","title":"Common guidelines and checklist"},{"location":"setup/deployment_checklist/#security-guidelines-and-checklist","text":"Given below are the common security guidelines for deploying a WSO2 product in a production environment.

If your WSO2 product version is supported by WSO2 Update Manager (WUM), you need to use WUM to get the latest fixes. If your WSO2 product is listed as a WUM-supported product here , follow the instructions in Getting Started with WUM . If you are using an older WSO2 product version, which is not WUM-supported, you need to download the security patches relevant to your product from the WSO2 Security Patch Release page and apply them to your system manually. The instructions are given in WSO2 Patch Application Process . !!! note Note the following: WSO2 releases security patch notifications monthly via the Support Portal and the above mentioned WSO2 Security Patch Releases page. However, for highly critical issues, patches are issued immediately to customers. The WSO2 Security Patch Release page has all the security patches for the latest product versions. WSO2 does not issue patches publicly for older product versions. Community users are encouraged to use the latest product version to receive all the security fixes. Change default keystores Change the default key stores and create new keys for all the cryptographic operations. WSO2 products by default come with a self-signed SSL key. Since these keys are public, it is recommended to configure your own keys for security purposes. Consider the following guidelines when creating the keystores: Select a key size of at least 2048 bits. Use an SHA256 certificate. Make sure that WSO2 default certificates do not exist in any of the keystores in your production environment. For example, be sure to delete the default public certificate in the default trust store that is shipped with the product. See the recommendations for using keystores in WSO2 products for information. See Creating New Keystores for information on how to create and configure your own keys. Encrypt passwords in configuration files WSO2 products use a tool called Secure Vault to encrypt the plain-text passwords in configuration files. See Securing Passwords in Configuration Files for instructions. Change default ports All the default ports used by WSO2 products are listed in Default Ports of WSO2 Products . For example, the default HTTPS port is 9443 and the HTTP port is 9763. Also, Axis2 services are exposed over the following ports: 8243 and 8280.

This value is in the number of records and depends on the database type and server capacity. It also depends on the amount of load generated by single sign-on (SSO). A higher value increases the chances of deadlocks and a lower value increases the time it takes for a cleanup. <DeleteChunkSize> 50000 </DeleteChunkSize> For more information on configuring sessions in production, see Authentication Session Persistence in the WSO2 Identity Server documentation.

Guideline Details Create a failover setup When your WSO2 products are clustered, you need to regularly monitor the health of your server instances. For example, you need to monitor resource-level factors such as the server's resource utilization, response time anomalies, and the number of incoming network connections. Server monitoring will help you identify when additional server instances (failover instances) are required. You can also make decisions about network routing changes that you need to do in order to avoid server downtime. See Deployment and Clustering/Key Concepts for information on configuring failover. See Monitoring WSO2 products for information on the monitoring options for WSO2 products. Maintain network level logging Be sure to maintain and monitor logs for your proxy servers, load balancers, and other network devices. Check open ports and services Periodically check for open ports using port scanning tools and make sure that only the necessary ports are open to both internal and external networks. Be sure that only the ports relevant to your WSO2 products are open for communication. If there are other ports started, be sure to monitor them. See Default Ports of WSO2 Products for the full list of ports in all WSO2 products. Configure device-level security All your network devices should be periodically checked for anomalies. For example, you need to verify routing tables and firewall rules. Also, make sure that the default credentials are changed before the first use of those devices. Apply firmware updates Firmware updates for your network devices should be applied regularly. Block the /services and /carbon contexts from the DMZ Access to the \"/services\" and \"/carbon\" contexts should be blocked from the DMZ level (i.e., from the proxy server, load balancer and/or firewall). The \"/services\" context is used in WSO2 products to expose admin services. These admin services are used for performing administrative operations using SOAP requests. The \"/carbon\" context is used in WSO2 products to expose the management console (administration console) of the product. The management console is a user interface for performing some of the administrative operations of a product. In addition to the \"/services\" and \"/carbon\" contexts, be sure to expose only the required applications in your product to users beyond the DMZ level in your network. !!! note It is recommended to use a whitelisting approach when allowing access to resources in your product from the DMZ level.","title":"Network-level security"},{"location":"setup/deployment_synchronization/","text":"Use the following deployment synchronization recommendations based on the rate of change of artifacts that happen in your cluster: If your artifacts are changing frequently, use Network File Share (NFS). If your artifacts are changing at a medium rate, use Remote Synchronization (Rsync).

It enables you to achieve greater levels of fault tolerance in your cluster and provides the required balancing of load needed to distribute traffic. These configurations are not required if your clustering setup does not have a load balancer. The load balancer ports of the deployment pattern that is shown above are HTTP 80 and HTTPS 443. If your system uses any other ports, be sure to replace 80 and 443 values with the corresponding ports when you follow the configuration steps in this section. The load balancer directs requests to the server on a round robin basis. For example, the load balancer will direct requests to node 1 ( xxx.xxx.xxx.xx1 ) of the ESB cluster as follows: HTTP requests will be directed to node 1 using the http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx1/<service> URL via HTTP 80 port. HTTPS requests will be directed to node 1 using the https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx1/<service> URL via HTTPS 443 port. The management console of node 1 will be accessed using the https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx1/carbon/ URL via HTTPS 443 port. It is recommended to use NGINX Plus as your load balancer of choice. Configuring the load balancer \u00b6 Follow the steps below to configure NGINX Plus version 1.7.11 or NGINX community version 1.9.2 as the load balancer. Install NGINX Plus or the NGINX community version on your cluster network. Create a VHost file named ei.http.conf in the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory and add the following configurations. This configures NGINX Plus to direct the HTTP requests to the two ESB nodes (xxx.xxx.xxx.xx1 and xxx.xxx.xxx.xx2) via the HTTP 80 port using the http://ei.wso2.com/ URL. If you are setting up NGINX on a Mac OS, you will not have the conf.d directory.

Analyzing a stack trace Capturing the state of the system Viewing process threads in Solaris Checking the health of a cluster Analyzing a stack trace \u00b6 When your Java process starts to spin your CPU, you must immediately analyze the issue using the following two commands and obtain the invaluable information required to tackle the issue. This is done based on the process ID (pid). jstack <pid> > thread-dump.txt ps -C java -L -o pcpu,cpu,nice,state,cputime,pid,tid > thread-usage.txt !!! tip **Tip** : OS X users can alternatively use the command ` ps M <PID> ` instead. These commands provide you with the thread-dump.txt file and the thread-usage.txt file. After obtaining these two files, do the following. Find the thread ID (the one that belongs to the corresponding PID) that takes up the highest CPU usage by examining the thread-usage.txt file. %CPU CPU NI S TIME PID TID .......... 0.0 - 0 S 00:00:00 1519 1602 0.0 - 0 S 00:00:00 1519 1603 24.8 - 0 R 00:06:19 1519 1604 2.4 - 0 S 00:00:37 1519 1605 0.0 - 0 S 00:00:00 1519 1606 .......... In this example, the thread ID that takes up the highest CPU usage is 1604. Convert the decimal value (in this case 1604) to hexadecimal. You can use an online converter to do this. The hexadecimal value for 1604 is 644. Search the thread-dump.txt file for the hexadecimal obtained in order to identify the thread that spins. In this case, the hexadecimal value to search for is 644. The thread-dump.txt file should have that value as a thread ID of one thread. That thread usually has a stack trace, and that's the lead you need to find the issue. In this example, the stack trace of the thread that spins is as follows. \"HTTPS-Sender I/O dispatcher-1\" prio=10 tid=0x00007fb54c010000 nid=0x644 runnable [0x00007fb534e20000] java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.IOSessionImpl.getEventMask(IOSessionImpl.java:139) - locked <0x00000006cd91fef8> (a org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.IOSessionImpl) at org.apache.http.nio.reactor.ssl.SSLIOSession.updateEventMask(SSLIOSession.java:300) at org.apache.http.nio.reactor.ssl.SSLIOSession.inboundTransport(SSLIOSession.java:402) - locked <0x00000006cd471df8> (a org.apache.http.nio.reactor.ssl.SSLIOSession) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.AbstractIODispatch.inputReady(AbstractIODispatch.java:121) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.BaseIOReactor.readable(BaseIOReactor.java:160) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.AbstractIOReactor.processEvent(AbstractIOReactor.java:342) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.AbstractIOReactor.processEvents(AbstractIOReactor.java:320) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.AbstractIOReactor.execute(AbstractIOReactor.java:280) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.BaseIOReactor.execute(BaseIOReactor.java:106) at org.apache.http.impl.nio.reactor.AbstractMultiworkerIOReactor$Worker.run(AbstractMultiworkerIOReactor.java:604) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722) Capturing the state of the system \u00b6 Carbondump is a tool used to collect all the necessary data from a running WSO2 product instance at the time of an error. The carbondump generates a ZIP archive with the collected data that helps to analyze the system and determine the problem that caused the error. Therefore, it is recommended that you run this tool as soon as an error occurs in the WSO2 product instance. When using the tool, you have to provide the process ID (pid) of the product instance and the <PRODUCT_HOME> location, which is where your unzipped Carbon distribution files reside. The command takes the following format: sh carbondump.sh [-carbonHome path] [-pid of the carbon instance] For example, In Linux: sh carbondump.sh -carbonHome /home/user/wso2carbon-3.0.0/ -pid 5151 In Windows: carbondump.bat -carbonHome c:\\wso2carbon-3.0.0\\ -pid 5151 The tool captures the following information about the system: Operating system information ** OS (kernel) version Installed modules lists and their information List of running tasks in the system Memory information of the Java process ** Java heap memory dump Histogram of the heap Objects waiting for finalization Java heap summary. GC algo used, etc. Statistics on permgen space of Java heap Information about the running Carbon instance ** Product name and version Carbon framework version (This includes the patched version) \\<PRODUCT_HOME>, \\<JAVA_HOME> configuration files log files H2 database files Thread dump Checksum values of all the files found in the $CARBON_HOME Viewing process threads in Solaris \u00b6 This information is useful to know in situations when the database processes are not fully utilizing the CPU's threading capabilities. It gives you a better understanding on how 11g and 10g takes advantage of threading and how you can validate those queries from the system. The following information provides insight on whether a Solaris process is parallelized and is taking advantage of the threading within the CPU. Open a command line in Solaris. Run prstat and have a look to the last column, labeled PROCESS/NLWP . NLWP is a reference to the number of lightweight processes and are the number of threads the process is currently using with Solaris as there is a one-to-one mapping between lightweight processes and user threads. A single thread process will show 1 there while a multi-threaded one will show a larger number. See the following code block for an example. PID USERNAME SIZE RSS STATE PRI NICE TIME CPU PROCESS/NLWP ... 12905 root 4472K 3640K cpu0 59 0 0:00:01 0.4% prstat/1 18403 monitor 474M 245M run 59 17 1:01:28 9.1% java/103 4102 oracle 12G 12G run 59 0 0:00:12 4.5% oracle/1 If you observe the PROCESS/NLWP value in the example above, you can identify that prstat and oracle are single thread processes, while java is a multi-threaded process. Alternatively, you can analyze individual thread activity of a multi-threaded process by using the -L and -p options, like prstat -L -p pid . This displays a line for each thread sorted by CPU activity. In that case, the last column is labeled PROCESS/LWPID , where LWPID is the thread ID. If more than one thread shows significant activity, your process is actively taking advantage of multi-threading. Checking the health of a cluster \u00b6 In Hazelcast, the health of a member in the cluster is determined by the heartbeats the member sends. If the well-known member does not receive a heartbeat within a given amount of time (this can be configured), then the node is assumed dead. By default, the given amount of time is 600 seconds (or 10mins), which might be too much for some scenarios. Failure detectors used in distributed systems can be unreliable. In these sort of scenarios, Hazelcast uses heartbeat monitoring as a fault detection mechanism and the nodes send heartbeats to other nodes. If a heartbeat message is not received by a given amount of time, Hazelcast assumes the node is dead. This is configured via the hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds property. The optimum value for this property depends on the system. Although the default is 600 seconds, it might be necessary to reduce the heartbeat to a lower value if nodes are to be declared dead in a shorter time frame. However, you must verify this in your system and adjust as necessary depending on your scenario. Warning Warning : Reducing the value of this property to a lower value can result in nodes being considered as dead even if they are not. This results in multiple messages indicating that a node is leaving and rejoining the cluster. Do the following steps to configure the maximum time between heartbeats. Create a property file called hazelcast.properties, and add the following property to it. hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds=300 Place this file in the <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/ directory in all the nodes in your cluster.
